# A-law


An A-law algorithm is a standard companding algorithm, used in European
8-bit PCM digital communications systems to optimize, i.e. modify, the
dynamic range of an analog signal for digitizing. It is one of two
versions of the G.711 standard from ITU-T, the other version being the
similar µ-law, used in North America and Japan.
