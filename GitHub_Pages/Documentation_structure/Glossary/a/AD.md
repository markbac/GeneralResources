Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed
for the Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server
operating systems as a set of processes and services. Initially, Active
Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management. Starting
with Windows Server 2008, however, Active Directory became an umbrella
title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.

A server running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is called a
domain controller. It authenticates and authorizes all users and
computers in a Windows domain type network---assigning and enforcing
security policies for all computers and installing or updating software.
For example, when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows
domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines
whether the user is a system administrator or normal user. Also, it
allows management and storage of information, provides authentication
and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy
other related services: Certificate Services, Federated Services,
Lightweight Directory Services and Rights Management Services.

Active Directory uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version of Kerberos, and DNS.
