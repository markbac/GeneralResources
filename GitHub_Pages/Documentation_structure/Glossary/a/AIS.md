# AIS


Alarm Indication Signaling

Alarm indication signal (AIS) (also called "all ones" because of the
data and framing pattern) is a signal transmitted by an intermediate
element of a multi-node transport circuit that is part of a concatenated
telecommunications system to alert the receiving end of the circuit that
a segment of the end-to-end link has failed at a logical or physical
level, even if the system it is directly connected to is still working.
The AIS replaces the failed data, allowing the higher order system in
the concatenation to maintain its transmission framing integrity.
Downstream intermediate elements of the transport circuit propagate the
AIS onwards to the destination element.
