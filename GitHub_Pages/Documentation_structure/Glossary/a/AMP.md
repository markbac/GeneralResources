# AMP


Asymmetric Multiprocessing

In an asymmetric multiprocessing system (AMP), not all CPUs are treated
equally; for example, a system might allow (either at the hardware or
operating system level) only one CPU to execute operating system code or
might allow only one CPU to perform I/O operations. Other AMP systems
would allow any CPU to execute operating system code and perform I/O
operations, so that they were symmetric with regard to processor roles,
but attached some or all peripherals to particular CPUs, so that they
were asymmetric with respect to the peripheral attachment. Asymmetric
multiprocessing was the only method for handling multiple CPUs before
symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) was available. It has also been used to
provide less expensive options on systems where SMP was available.
Additionally, AMP is used in applications that are dedicated, such as
embedded systems, when individual processors can be dedicated to
specific tasks at design time.

Multiprocessing is the use of more than one CPU in a computer system.
The CPU is the arithmetic and logic engine that executes user
applications. With multiple CPUs, more than one set of program
instructions can be executed at the same time. All of the CPUs have the
same user-mode instruction set, so a running job can be rescheduled from
one CPU to another.
