# ANDSF


Access Network Discovery and Selection Function

The ANDSF provides information to the UE about connectivity to 3GPP and
non-3GPP access networks (such as Wi-Fi). The purpose of the ANDSF is to
assist the UE to discover the access networks in their vicinity and to
provide rules (policies) to prioritize and manage connections to these
networks.\
