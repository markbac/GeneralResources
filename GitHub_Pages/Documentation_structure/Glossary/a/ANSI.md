American National Standards Institute

The American National Standards Institute is a private non-profit
organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus
standards for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in
the United States. The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with
international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.

ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other
standards organizations, government agencies, consumer groups,
companies, and others. These standards ensure that the characteristics
and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same
definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way. ANSI
also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel
certification in accordance with requirements defined in international
standards
