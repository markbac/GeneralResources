# Acceptance Testing


An acceptance test is a formal description of the behavior of a software
product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario. A number
of different notations and approaches have been proposed for such
examples or scenarios. In many cases the aim is that it should be
possible to automate the execution of such tests by a software tool,
either ad-hoc to the development team or off the shelf.
