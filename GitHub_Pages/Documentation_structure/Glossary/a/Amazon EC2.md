# Amazon EC2


Amazon Electric Compute Cloud

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) forms a central part of Amazon.com's
cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), by allowing users
to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer
applications. EC2 encourages scalable deployment of applications by
providing a web service through which a user can boot an Amazon Machine
Image (AMI) to configure a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an
"instance", containing any software desired. A user can create, launch,
and terminate server-instances as needed, paying by the second for
active servers -- hence the term "elastic". EC2 provides users with
control over the geographical location of instances that allows for
latency optimization and high levels of redundancy.
