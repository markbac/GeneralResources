# B2C


business-to-consumer

Business to consumer (B2C) refers to the transactions conducted directly
between a company and consumers who are the end-users of its products or
services. The business to consumer as a business model differs
significantly from the business-to-business model, which refers to
commerce between two or more businesses. While most companies that sell
directly to consumers can be referred to as B2C companies, the term
became immensely popular during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when
it was used mainly to refer to online retailers, as well as other
companies that sold products and services to consumers through the
internet.
