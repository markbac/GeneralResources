# BASIC


BASIC (an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)
is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose
design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. In 1964, John G. Kemeny,
Thomas E. Kurtz and Sr. Mary Kenneth Keller designed the original BASIC
language at Dartmouth College. They wanted to enable students in fields
other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly
all use of computers required writing custom software, which was
something only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn.
