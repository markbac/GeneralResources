Border Gateway Protocol

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway
protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among
autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. The protocol is classified as a
path vector protocol. The Border Gateway Protocol makes routing
decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a
network administrator and is involved in making core routing decisions.
