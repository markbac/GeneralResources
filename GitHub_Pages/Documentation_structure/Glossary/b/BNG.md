Broadband Network Gateway

The Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) allows subscribers to connect to a
broadband network through an access portal. It creates and manages
subscriber sessions, aggregating traffic from various subscriber
sessions from an access network, and routing it to the network of the
Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Network Service Provider (NSP).
