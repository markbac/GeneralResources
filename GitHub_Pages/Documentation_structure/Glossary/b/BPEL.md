Business Process Execution Language

BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) is an XML-based language that
allows Web services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA) to
interconnect and share data.

Programmers use BPEL to define how a business process that involves web
services will be executed. BPEL messages are typically used to invoke
remote services, orchestrate process execution and manage events and
exceptions.

BPEL is often associated with Business Process Management Notation
(BPMN), a standard for representing business processes graphically. In
many organizations, analysts use BPMN to visualize business processes
and developers transform the visualizations to BPEL for execution.

BPEL was standardized by OASIS in 2004 after collaborative efforts to
create the language by Microsoft, IBM and other companies.
