Business Process Model and Notation

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a graphical representation
for specifying business processes in a business process model.

Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI) developed BPMN, which has
been maintained by the Object Management Group since the two
organizations merged in 2005. Version 2.0 of BPMN was released in
January 2011, at which point the name was adapted to Business
Process Model and Notation as execution semantics were also introduced
alongside the notational and diagramming elements.\
