# BT 21CN


BT 21st Century Network

21CN involves a huge overhaul of the existing 20CN network. Over the
next few years BT will gradually be updating the existing equipment and
replacing it with a new multi-service network.

The PSTN (telephone) services will be provided over the same IP network
as broadband. This will involve replacing telephone switching equipment
and the adsl broadband DSLAMs with MSANs (Multi-Service Access Nodes)
which will terminate telephone and broadband connections.\
Note: Plans to also move the telephone network over to IP has been
temporary been abandoned by BT.

As well as faster speeds the new equipment will also allow BT more
configuration options and allow them to offer products with QoS (Quality
of Service) availability.
