Base Transceiver Station

A base transceiver station (BTS) is a piece of equipment that
facilitates wireless communication between user equipment (UE) and a
network. UEs are devices like mobile phones (handsets), WLL phones,
computers with wireless Internet connectivity. The network can be that
of any of the wireless communication technologies like GSM, CDMA,
wireless local loop, Wi-Fi, WiMAX or other wide area network (WAN)
technology.

BTS is also referred to as the node B (in 3G Networks) or, simply, the
Base Station (BS). For discussion of the LTE standard the abbreviation
eNB for evolved node B is widely used
