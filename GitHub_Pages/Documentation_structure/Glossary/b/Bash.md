# Bash


Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the
GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First
released in 1989, it has been distributed widely as the default login
shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS (formerly OS X). A
version is also available for Windows 10. It is also the default user
shell in Solaris 11.

Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where
the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and
execute commands from a file, called a shell script. Like all Unix
shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here
documents, command substitution, variables, and control
structures for condition-testing and iteration. The keywords, syntax and
other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. Other
features, e.g., history, are copied from csh and ksh. Bash is a
POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions.

The shell's name is an acronym for Bourne-again shell, a pun on the name
of the Bourne shell that it replaces.
