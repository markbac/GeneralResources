# Bluetooth


Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over
short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band
from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building
personal area networks (PANs). Invented by Dutch electrical engineer
Jaap Haartsen, working for telecom vendor Ericsson in 1994, it was
originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables.

Bluetooth is managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG),
which has more than 30,000 member companies in the areas of
telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics. The
IEEE standardized Bluetooth as IEEE 802.15.1, but no longer maintains
the standard.
