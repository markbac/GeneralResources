# C-Tag


Subscriber VLAN Tag

The IEEE standard 802.1ad provides for double-tagging by service
providers so that they can use VLANs allocated internally together with
traffic already tagged as VLANs by service provider customers.

In this double tagging, the C-Tag (customer tag) is the inner tag set by
the customer. The S-Tag is the outer tag next to the MAC address.\
