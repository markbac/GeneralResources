Certificate Authority

In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA)
is an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate
certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the
certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon
signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds
to the certified public key. A CA acts as a trusted third
party---trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by
the party relying upon the certificate. The format of these certificates
is specified by the X.509 standard.

One particularly common use for certificate authorities is to sign
certificates used in HTTPS, the secure browsing protocol for the World
Wide Web. Another common use is in issuing identity cards by national
governments for use in electronically signing documents.
