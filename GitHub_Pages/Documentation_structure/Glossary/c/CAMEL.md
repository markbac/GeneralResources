Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic

Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) is a
set of standards designed to work on either a GSM core network or the
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network. The framework
provides tools for operators to define additional features for standard
GSM services/UMTS services. The CAMEL architecture is based on the
Intelligent Network (IN) standards, and uses the CAP protocol. The
protocols are codified in a series of ETSI Technical Specifications.

Many services can be created using CAMEL, and it is particularly
effective in allowing these services to be offered when a subscriber is
roaming, like, for instance, no-prefix dialing (the number the user
dials is the same no matter the country where the call is placed) or
seamless MMS message access from abroad.
