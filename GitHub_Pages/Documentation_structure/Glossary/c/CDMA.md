# CDMA


Code-division multiple access

Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method used by
various radio communication technologies.

CDMA is an example of multiple access, where several transmitters can
send information simultaneously over a single communication channel.
This allows several users to share a band of frequencies . To permit
this without undue interference between the users, CDMA employs spread
spectrum technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter
is assigned a code).

CDMA is used as the access method in many mobile phone standards. IS-95,
also called "cdmaOne", and its 3G evolution CDMA2000, are often simply
referred to as "CDMA", but UMTS, the 3G standard used by GSM carriers,
also uses "wideband CDMA", or W-CDMA, as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA,
as its radio technologies.
