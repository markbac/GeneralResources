# CDMA2000


Code-division multiple access 2000

CDMA2000 (also known as C2K or IMT Multi Carrier (IMT MC)) is a family
of 3G mobile technology standards for sending voice, data, and signaling
data between mobile phones and cell sites. It is developed by 3GPP2 as a
backwards-compatible successor to second-generation cdmaOne (IS-95) set
of standards and used especially in North America and South Korea.

CDMA2000 compares to UMTS, a competing set of 3G standards, which is
developed by 3GPP and used in Europe, Japan, and China.
