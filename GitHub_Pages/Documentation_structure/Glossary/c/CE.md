# CE


Customer Edge

The customer edge (CE) is the router at the customer premises that is
connected to the provider edge of a service provider IP/MPLS network. CE
peers with the Provider Edge (PE) and exchanges routes with the
corresponding VRF inside the PE. The routing protocol used could be
static or dynamic (an interior gateway protocol like OSPF or an exterior
gateway protocol like BGP).\
