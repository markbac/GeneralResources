# CER


Canonical Encoding Rules

CER (Canonical Encoding Rules) is a restricted variant of
BER for producing unequivocal transfer syntax for data structures
described by ASN.1. Whereas BER gives choices as to how data values may
be encoded, CER (together with DER) selects just one encoding from those
allowed by the basic encoding rules, eliminating rest of the options.
CER is useful when the encodings must be preserved; e.g., in security
exchanges.
