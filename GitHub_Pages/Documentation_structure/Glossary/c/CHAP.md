# CHAP


Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol

In computing, the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
authenticates a user or network host to an authenticating entity. That
entity may be, for example, an Internet service provider. CHAP is
specified in RFC 1994.

CHAP provides protection against replay attacks by the peer through the
use of an incrementally changing identifier and of a variable
challenge-value. CHAP requires that both the client and server know the
plaintext of the secret, although it is never sent over the network.
Thus, CHAP provides better security as compared to Password
Authentication Protocol (PAP) which is vulnerable for both these
reasons. The MS-CHAP variant does not require either peer to know the
plaintext and does not transmit it, but has been broken
