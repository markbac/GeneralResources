configuration management database

A configuration management database (CMDB) is a data repository that
acts as a data warehouse or inventory for information technology (IT)
installations. It holds data relating to a collection of IT assets
(commonly referred to as configuration items (CI)), as well as to
descriptive relationships between such assets. The repository provides a
means of understanding:

- the composition of critical assets such as information systems

- the upstream sources or dependencies of assets\
    the downstream targets of assets
