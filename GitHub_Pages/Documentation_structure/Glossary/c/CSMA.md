# CSMA


Carrier-sense multiple access

Carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) is a media access control (MAC)
protocol in which a node verifies the absence of other traffic before
transmitting on a shared transmission medium, such as an electrical bus
or a band of the electromagnetic spectrum.

A transmitter attempts to determine whether another transmission is in
progress before initiating a transmission using a carrier-sense
mechanism. That is, it tries to detect the presence of a carrier signal
from another node before attempting to transmit. If a carrier is sensed,
the node waits for the transmission in progress to end before initiating
its own transmission. Using CSMA, multiple nodes may, in turn, send and
receive on the same medium. Transmissions by one node are generally
received by all other nodes connected to the medium.

Variations on basic CSMA include addition of collision-avoidance,
collision-detection and collision-resolution techniques.
