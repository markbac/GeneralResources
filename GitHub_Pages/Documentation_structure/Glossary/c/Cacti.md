# Cacti


Cacti is an open-source, web-based network monitoring and graphing tool
designed as a front-end application for the open-source,
industry-standard data logging tool RRDtool. Cacti allows a user to poll
services at predetermined intervals and graph the resulting data. It is
generally used to graph time-series data of metrics such as CPU load and
network bandwidth utilization. A common usage is to monitor network
traffic by polling a network switch or router interface via Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
