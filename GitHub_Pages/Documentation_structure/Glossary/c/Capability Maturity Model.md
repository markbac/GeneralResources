# Capability Maturity Model


The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a development model created after
a study of data collected from organizations that contracted with the
U.S. Department of Defense, who funded the research. The term "maturity"
relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from
ad hoc practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics,
to active optimization of the processes.

The model's aim is to improve existing software development processes,
but it can also be applied to other processes.

Structure\
The model involves five aspects:

- Maturity Levels: a 5-level process maturity continuum - where the
    uppermost (5th) level is a notional ideal state where processes
    would be systematically managed by a combination of process
    optimization and continuous process improvement.

- Key Process Areas: a Key Process Area identifies a cluster of
    related activities that, when performed together, achieve a set of
    goals considered important.

- Goals: the goals of a key process area summarize the states that
    must exist for that key process area to have been implemented in an
    effective and lasting way. The extent to which the goals have been
    accomplished is an indicator of how much capability the organization
    has established at that maturity level. The goals signify the scope,
    boundaries, and intent of each key process area.

- Common Features: common features include practices that implement
    and institutionalize a key process area. There are five types of
    common features: commitment to perform, ability to perform,
    activities performed, measurement and analysis, and verifying
    implementation.

- Key Practices: The key practices describe the elements of
    infrastructure and practice that contribute most effectively to the
    implementation and institutionalization of the area.

    Levels\
    There are five levels defined along the continuum of the model and,
    according to the SEI: "Predictability, effectiveness, and control of
    an organization's software processes are believed to improve as the
    organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the
    empirical evidence to date supports this belief".

- Initial (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point
    for use of a new or undocumented repeat process.

- Repeatable - the process is at least documented sufficiently such
    that repeating the same steps may be attempted.

- Defined - the process is defined/confirmed as a standard business
    process

- Capable - the process is quantitatively managed in accordance with
    agreed-upon metrics.

- Efficient - process management includes deliberate process
    optimization/improvement.

    Within each of these maturity levels are Key Process Areas which
    characterise that level, and for each such area there are five
    factors: goals, commitment, ability, measurement, and verification.
    These are not necessarily unique to CMM, representing --- as they do
    --- the stages that organizations must go through on the way to
    becoming mature.

    The model provides a theoretical continuum along which process
    maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the next.
    Skipping levels is not allowed/feasible.
