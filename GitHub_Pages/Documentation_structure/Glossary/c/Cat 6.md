# Cat 6


Category 6 cable, commonly referred to as Cat 6, is a standardized
twisted pair cable for Ethernet and other network physical layers that
is backward compatible with the Category 5/5e and Category 3 cable
standards.

Compared with Cat 5 and Cat 5e, Cat 6 features more stringent
specifications for crosstalk and system noise. The cable standard also
specifies performance of up to 250 MHz compared to 100 MHz for Cat 5 and
Cat 5e.

Whereas Category 6 cable has a reduced maximum length of 55 meters when
used for 10GBASE-T, Category 6A cable (or Augmented Category 6) is
characterized to 500 MHz and has improved alien crosstalk
characteristics, allowing 10GBASE-T to be run for the same 100 meter
maximum distance as previous Ethernet variants.
