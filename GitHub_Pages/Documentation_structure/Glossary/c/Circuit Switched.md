# Circuit Switched


Circuit switching is a method of implementing a telecommunications
network in which two network nodes establish a dedicated communications
channel (circuit) through the network before the nodes may communicate.
The circuit guarantees the full bandwidth of the channel and remains
connected for the duration of the communication session. The circuit
functions as if the nodes were physically connected as with an
electrical circuit.\
