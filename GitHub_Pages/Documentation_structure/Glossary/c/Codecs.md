# Codecs


A codec is a device or computer program for encoding or decoding a
digital data stream or signal. Codec is a portmanteau of coder-decoder.

A codec encodes a data stream or a signal for transmission and storage,
possibly in encrypted form, and the decoder function reverses the
encoding for playback or editing. Codecs are used in videoconferencing,
streaming media, and video editing applications.\
