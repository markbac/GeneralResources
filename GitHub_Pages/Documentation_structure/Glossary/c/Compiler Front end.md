# Compiler Front end


The front end verifies syntax and semantics according to a specific
source language. For statically typed languages it performs type
checking by collecting type information. If the input program is
syntactically incorrect or has a type error, it generates errors and
warnings, highlighting\[dubious -- discuss\] them on the source code.
Aspects of the front end include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and
semantic analysis. The front end transforms the input program into an
intermediate representation (IR) for further processing by the middle
end. This IR is usually a lower-level representation of the program with
respect to the source code
