# Continuous Deployment


Continuous deployment aims to reduce the time elapsed between writing a
line of code and making that code available to users in production. To
achieve continuous deployment, the team relies on infrastructure that
automates and instruments the various steps leading up to deployment, so
that after each integration successfully meeting these release criteria,
the live application is updated with new code.
