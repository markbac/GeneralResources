# csh


The C shell (csh or the improved version, tcsh) is a Unix shell created
by Bill Joy while he was a graduate student at University of California,
Berkeley in the late 1970s. It has been widely distributed, beginning
with the 2BSD release of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) that
Joy began distributing in 1978. Other early contributors to the ideas or
the code were Michael Ubell, Eric Allman, Mike O'Brien and Jim Kulp.

The C shell is a command processor typically run in a text window,
allowing the user to type commands. The C shell can also read commands
from a file, called a script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename
wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and
control structures for condition-testing and iteration. What
differentiated the C shell from others, especially in the 1980s, were
its interactive features and overall style. Its new features made it
easier and faster to use. The overall style of the language looked more
like C and was seen as more readable.
