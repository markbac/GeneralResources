# DDOS


Distributed Denial of Service

In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack
in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource
unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely
disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of
service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or
resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and
prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.\[1\]

In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming
traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This
effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a
single source.

A DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the
entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter,
disrupting trade.
