Directory Number

A telephone number is a sequence of digits assigned to a fixed-line
telephone subscriber station connected to a telephone line or to a
wireless electronic telephony device, such as a radio telephone or a
mobile telephone, or to other devices for data transmission via the
public switched telephone network (PSTN) or other private networks.

A telephone number serves as an address for switching telephone calls
using a system of destination code routing. Telephone numbers are
entered or dialed by a calling party on the originating telephone set,
which transmits the sequence of digits in the process of signaling to a
telephone exchange. The exchange completes the call either to another
locally connected subscriber or via the PSTN to the called party.
Telephone numbers are assigned within the framework of a national or
regional telephone numbering plan to subscribers by telephone service
operators, which may be commercial entities, state-controlled
administrations, or other telecommunication industry associations.
