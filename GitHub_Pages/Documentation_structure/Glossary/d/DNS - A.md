IpV4 A Record

An A record maps a domain name to the IP address (IPv4) of the computer
hosting the domain. Simply put, an A record is used to find the IP
address of a computer connected to the internet from a name.

The A in A record stands for Address. Whenever you visit a web site,
send an email, connect to Twitter or Facebook or do almost anything on
the Internet, the address you enter is a series of words connected with
dots.
