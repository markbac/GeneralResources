# DNS Spoofing


DNS spoofing, also referred to as DNS cache poisoning, is a form of
computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is
introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to
return an incorrect result record, e.g. an IP address. This results in
traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other
computer).
