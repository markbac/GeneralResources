Domain Name System

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming
system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
Internet or a private network. It associates various information with
domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most
prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the
numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer
services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing
a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an
essential component of the functionality on the Internet, that has been
in use since 1985.
