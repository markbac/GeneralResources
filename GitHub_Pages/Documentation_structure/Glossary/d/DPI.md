Deep Packet Inspection

Deep packet inspection (DPI) is a type of data processing that inspects
in detail the data being sent over a computer network, and usually takes
action by blocking, re-routing, or logging it accordingly. Deep packet
inspection is often used to ensure that data is in the correct format,
to check for malicious code, eavesdropping and internet censorship\[1\]
among other purposes. There are multiple headers for IP packets; network
equipment only needs to use the first of these (the IP header) for
normal operation, but use of the second header (such as TCP or UDP) is
normally considered to be shallow packet inspection (usually called
stateful packet inspection) despite this definition.\[2\]

There are multiple ways to acquire packets for deep packet inspection.
Using port mirroring (sometimes called Span Port) is a very common way,
as well as an optical splitter.

Deep Packet Inspection (and filtering) enables advanced network
management, user service, and security functions as well as internet
data mining, eavesdropping, and internet censorship. Although DPI has
been used for Internet management for many years, some advocates of net
neutrality fear that the technique may be used anticompetitively or to
reduce the openness of the Internet.\[3\]

DPI is used in a wide range of applications, at the so-called
"enterprise" level (corporations and larger institutions), in
telecommunications service providers, and in governments.
