Diff-Serve Code Point

Differentiated services or DiffServ is a computer networking
architecture that specifies a simple and scalable mechanism for
classifying and managing network traffic and providing quality of
service (QoS) on modern IP networks. DiffServ can, for example, be used
to provide low-latency to critical network traffic such as voice or
streaming media while providing simple best-effort service to
non-critical services such as web traffic or file transfers.

DiffServ uses a 6-bit differentiated services code point (DSCP) in the
8-bit differentiated services field (DS field) in the IP header for
packet classification purposes. The DS field replaces the outdated IPv4
TOS field.
