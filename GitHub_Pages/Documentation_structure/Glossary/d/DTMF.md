# DTMF


Dual Tone Multi Frequency

Dual-tone multi-frequency signalling (DTMF) is an in-band
telecommunication signalling system using the voice-frequency band over
telephone lines between telephone equipment and other communications
devices and switching centres. DTMF was first developed in the Bell
System in the United States, and became known under the trademark
Touch-Tone for use in push-button telephones supplied to telephone
customers, starting in 1963.\[1\] DTMF is standardized as ITU-T
Recommendation Q.23.\[2\] It is also known in the UK as MF4.

The Touch-Tone system using a telephone keypad gradually replaced the
use of rotary dial and has become the industry standard for landline and
mobile service. Other multi-frequency systems are used for internal
signalling within the telephone network.\
