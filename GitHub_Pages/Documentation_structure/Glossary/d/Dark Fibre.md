# Dark Fibre


A dark fibre or unlit fibre is an unused optical fibre, available for
use in fibre-optic communication.

The term dark fibre was originally used when referring to the potential
network capacity of telecommunication infrastructure, but now also
refers to the increasingly common practice of leasing fibre optic cables
from a network service provider, or, generally, to the fibre
installations not owned or controlled by traditional carriers. In common
vernacular, dark fibre may sometimes still be called "dark" if it has
been lit by a fibre lessee and not the cable's owner.

A dark fibre network or simply dark network is a privately operated
optical fiber network that is run directly by its operator over dark
fibre leased or purchased from another supplier. This is in contrast to
purchasing bandwidth or leased line capacity on an existing network.
Dark fibre networks may be used for private networking, or as Internet
access or infrastructure.
