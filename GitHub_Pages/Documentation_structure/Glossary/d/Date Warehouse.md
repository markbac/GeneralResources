# Date Warehouse


In computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise
data warehouse (EDW), is a system used for reporting and data analysis,
and is considered a core component of business intelligence. DWs are
central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate
sources. They store current and historical data in one single place7that
are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the
enterprise.

The data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational
systems (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an
operational data store and may require data cleansing for additional
operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the DW for
reporting.
