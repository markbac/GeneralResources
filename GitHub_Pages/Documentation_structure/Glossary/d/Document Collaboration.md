# Document Collaboration


Document and file collaboration are the tools or systems set up to help
multiple people work together on a single document or file to achieve a
single final version. Normally, this is software that allows teams to
work on a single document, such as a Word document, at the same time
from different computer terminals or mobile devices. Hence, document or
file collaboration today is a system allowing people to collaborate
across different locations using an Internet, or "cloud", enabled
approach such as for Wikis such as Wikipedia

Tools such as Confluence & SharePoint can be used for Document
Collaboration
