# Dot1Q


IEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q

IEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q, is the networking standard that
supports virtual LANs (VLANs) on an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network. The
standard defines a system of VLAN tagging for Ethernet frames and the
accompanying procedures to be used by bridges and switches in handling
such frames. The standard also contains provisions for a
quality-of-service prioritization scheme commonly known as IEEE 802.1p
and defines the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol.

Portions of the network which are VLAN-aware (i.e., IEEE 802.1Q
conformant) can include VLAN tags. When a frame enters the VLAN-aware
portion of the network, a tag is added to represent the VLAN
membership.\[a\] Each frame must be distinguishable as being within
exactly one VLAN. A frame in the VLAN-aware portion of the network that
does not contain a VLAN tag is assumed to be flowing on the native VLAN.
