# E NodeB


Evolved Node-B

E-UTRAN Node B, also known as Evolved Node B (abbreviated as eNodeB or
eNB), is the element in E-UTRA of LTE that is the evolution of the
element Node B in UTRA of UMTS. It is the hardware that is connected to
the mobile phone network that communicates directly wirelessly with
mobile handsets (UEs), like a base transceiver station (BTS) in GSM
networks.

Traditionally, a Node B has minimum functionality, and is controlled by
a Radio Network Controller (RNC). However, with an eNB, there is no
separate controller element. This simplifies the architecture and allows
lower response times.
