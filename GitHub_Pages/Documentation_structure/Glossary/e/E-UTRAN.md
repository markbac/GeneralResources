# E-UTRAN


E-UTRA is the air interface of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
Long Term Evolution (LTE) upgrade path for mobile networks. It is an
acronym for Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)
Terrestrial Radio Access, also referred to as the 3GPP work item on the
Long Term Evolution (LTE) also known as the Evolved Universal
Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) in early drafts of the 3GPP LTE
specification. E-UTRAN is the initialism of Evolved UMTS Terrestrial
Radio Access Network and is the combination of E-UTRA, user equipment
(UE), and E-UTRAN Node B or Evolved Node B (EnodeB).

It is a radio access network (RAN) which is referred to under the name
EUTRAN standard meant to be a replacement of the UMTS and HSDPA/HSUPA
technologies specified in 3GPP releases 5 and beyond. Unlike HSPA, LTE's
E-UTRA is an entirely new air interface system, unrelated to and
incompatible with W-CDMA. It provides higher data rates, lower latency
and is optimized for packet data. It uses OFDMA radio-access for the
downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink.\
