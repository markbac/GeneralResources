# E.164


E.164 is an ITU-T recommendation, titled The international public
telecommunication numbering plan, that defines a numbering plan for the
worldwide public switched telephone network (PSTN) and some other data
networks.

E.164 defines a general format for international telephone numbers.
Plan-conforming numbers are limited to a maximum of 15 digits, excluding
the international call prefix.\[1\] The presentation of a number is
usually prefixed with the plus
signÂ ![(plus)](https://markbac.github.io/Glossary/images/icons/emoticons/add.png),
indicating that the number includes the country calling code. When
dialing, the number must typically be prefixed with the appropriate
international call prefix (in place of the plus sign), which is a trunk
code to reach an international circuit from within the country of call
origination.
