Ethernet Access Direct

Ethernet Access Direct (EAD) provides point-to-point data connectivity
between sites. It can be used to build and extend customer networks,
develop new infrastructure, and meet low-capacity backhaul requirements
(ie up to 1Gbps, which is the starting bandwidth for Ethernet Backhaul
Direct). EAD supports a range of requirements including cloud computing,
simultaneous online pupil access in classrooms and storage area network
connectivity.\
