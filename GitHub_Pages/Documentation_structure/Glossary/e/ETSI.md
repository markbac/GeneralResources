European Telecommunications Standards Institute

The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is an
independent, not-for-profit, standardization organization in the
telecommunications industry (equipment makers and network operators) in
Europe, headquartered in Sophia-Antipolis, France, with worldwide
projection. ETSI produces globally-applicable standards for Information
and Communications Technologies (ICT), including fixed, mobile, radio,
converged, broadcast and internet technologies.

ETSI was created by CEPT in 1988 and is officially recognized by the
European Commission and the EFTA secretariat. Based in Sophia Antipolis
(France), ETSI is officially responsible for standardization of
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) within Europe.

ETSI publishes between 2,000 and 2,500 standards every year. Since its
establishment in 1988, it has produced over 30,000. These include the
standards that enable key global technologies such as GSM cell phone
system, 3G, 4G, DECT, TETRA professional mobile radio system, and Short
Range Device requirements including LPD radio, smart cards and many more
standards success stories.

Significant ETSI technical committees and Industry Specification Groups
(ISGs) include SmartM2M (for machine-to-machine communications),
Intelligent Transport Systems, Network Functions Virtualisation, Cyber
Security, Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures etc. ETSI inspired
the creation of, and is a partner in, 3GPP and oneM2M.
