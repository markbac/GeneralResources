# EVC


Ethernet Virtual Connection

Ethernet virtual circuits (EVCs) define a Layer 2 bridging architecture
that supports Ethernet services. An EVC is defined by the Metro-Ethernet
Forum (MEF) as an association between two or more user network
interfaces that identifies a point-to-point or multipoint-to-multipoint
path within the service provider network. An EVC is a conceptual service
pipe within the service provider network. A bridge domain is a local
broadcast domain that exists separately from VLANs.
