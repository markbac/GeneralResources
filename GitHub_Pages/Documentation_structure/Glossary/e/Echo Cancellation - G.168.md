# Echo Cancellation - G.168


Echo has a major effect on voice quality in telecommunication networks.
The objectionable effect of echo results from a combination of
reflections from network components such as 2- to 4-wire converters,
together with signal processing and transmission delay. Echo may cause
users difficulty in\
talking or listening over a telephone connection. It may also affect the
transmission of voiceband data, fax, and text telephones.\
Digital network echo cancellers are designed to eliminate echo for the
user and to allow successful transmission of voiceband data and fax.
Recommendation ITU-T G.168 describes the characteristics of an echo
canceller, including the requirement for in-band tone disabling and
other control\
mechanisms. It also describes a number of laboratory tests that should
be performed on an echo canceller to assess its performance under
conditions likely to be experienced in the network
