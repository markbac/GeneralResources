# Echo


In audio signal processing and acoustics, Echo is a reflection of sound
that arrives at the listener with a delay after the direct sound. The
delay is proportional to the distance of the reflecting surface from the
source and the listener. Typical examples are the echo produced by the
bottom of a well, by a building, or by the walls of an enclosed room and
an empty room. A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source.
