# Estimate


The output of an estimation process, containing a description of inputs,
assumptions, methodology, and the resulting estimate values. Depending
on purpose and formality an *estimate*'s packaging can range from a
document containing complete output of several different estimation
techniques (see *project estimate*) to a terse summary (see *task
estimate*).
