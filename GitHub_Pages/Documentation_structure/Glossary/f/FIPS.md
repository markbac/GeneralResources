# FIPS


Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are publicly announced
standards developed by the United States federal government for use in
computer systems by non-military government agencies and government
contractors.

FIPS standards are issued to establish requirements for various purposes
such as ensuring computer security and interoperability, and are
intended for cases in which suitable industry standards do not already
exist. Many FIPS specifications are modified versions of standards used
in the technical communities, such as the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
