# FSK


Frequency-shift keying (FSK) is a frequency modulation scheme in which
digital information is transmitted through discrete frequency changes of
a carrier signal. The technology is used for communication systems such
as amateur radio, caller ID and emergency broadcasts. The simplest FSK
is binary FSK (BFSK). BFSK uses a pair of discrete frequencies to
transmit binary (0s and 1s) information. With this scheme, the "1" is
called the mark frequency and the "0" is called the space frequency.\
