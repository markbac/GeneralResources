# Firewall


n computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and
controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined
security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a
trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the
Internet.

Firewalls are often categorized as either network firewalls or
host-based firewalls. Network firewalls filter traffic between two or
more networks and run on network hardware. Host-based firewalls run on
host computers and control network traffic in and out of those
machines.\
