# Frame Relay


Frame Relay is a standardized wide area network technology that
specifies the physical and data link layers of digital
telecommunications channels using a packet switching methodology.
Originally designed for transport across Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) infrastructure, it may be used today in the context of
many other network interfaces.

Network providers commonly implement Frame Relay for voice (VoFR) and
data as an encapsulation technique used between local area networks
(LANs) over a wide area network (WAN). Each end-user gets a private line
(or leased line) to a Frame Relay node. The Frame Relay network handles
the transmission over a frequently changing path transparent to all
end-user extensively used WAN protocols. It is less expensive than
leased lines and that is one reason for its popularity. The extreme
simplicity of configuring user equipment in a Frame Relay network offers
another reason for Frame Relay's popularity.
