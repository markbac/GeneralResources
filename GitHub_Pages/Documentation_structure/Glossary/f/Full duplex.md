# Full duplex


In a full-duplex system, both parties can communicate with each other
simultaneously. An example of a full-duplex device is a telephone; the
parties at both ends of a call can speak and be heard by the other party
simultaneously. The earphone reproduces the speech of the remote party
as the microphone transmits the speech of the local party, because there
is a two-way communication channel between them, or more strictly
speaking, because there are two communication channels between them.
