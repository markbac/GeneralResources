# Fuzzy Front End


Term coined by Steve McConnell to describes the initial inception phases
of a project. CxOne defines the start of the fuzzy front end as the
point someone starts thinking about a project and working on chartering
it, and the end as the point at which the charter is approved and the
project begins.
