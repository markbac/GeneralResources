# Fuzzy Logic


A relative ranking technique for describing characteristics. Often used
in conjunction with items that contain uncertainty, like estimates. A
general example is to take three buckets called small, medium, and
large. Items are assigned t each bucket, and then the bucket values are
used as stand-ins for a possible range of quantitative values. One
common characteristic of fuzzy logic buckets is that the high end value
from one bucket overlaps the low end value of the next bucket.
