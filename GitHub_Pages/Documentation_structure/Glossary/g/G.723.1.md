# G.723.1


G.723.1 is an audio codec for voice that compresses voice audio in 30 ms
frames. An algorithmic look-ahead of 7.5 ms duration means that total
algorithmic delay is 37.5 ms. Its official name is Dual rate speech
coder for multimedia communications transmitting at 5.3 and 6.3 kbit/s.
It is sometimes associated with a Truespeech trademark in coprocessors
produced by DSP Group.\[1\]

This is a completely different codec from G.723.

There are two bit rates at which G.723.1 can operate:

6.3 kbit/s (using 24 byte frames) using a MPC-MLQ algorithm (MOS 3.9)\
5.3 kbit/s (using 20 byte frames) using an ACELP algorithm (MOS 3.62)
