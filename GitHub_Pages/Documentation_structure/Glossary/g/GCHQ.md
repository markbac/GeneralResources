Government Communications Headquarters

The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) is an intelligence and
security organisation responsible for providing signals intelligence
(SIGINT) and information assurance to the government and armed forces of
the United Kingdom. Based in "The Doughnut" in the suburbs of
Cheltenham, GCHQ is the responsibility of the country's Secretary of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, but it is not a part of the
Foreign Office and its director ranks as a Permanent Secretary.

GCHQ was originally established after the First World War as the
Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) and was known under that name
until 1946. During the Second World War it was located at Bletchley
Park, where it was responsible for breaking of the German Enigma codes.
Currently there are two main components of the GCHQ, the Composite
Signals Organisation (CSO), which is responsible for gathering
information, and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is
responsible for securing the UK's own communications. The Joint
Technical Language Service (JTLS) is a small department and
cross-government resource responsible for mainly technical language
support and translation and interpreting services across government
departments. It is co-located with GCHQ for administrative purposes.
