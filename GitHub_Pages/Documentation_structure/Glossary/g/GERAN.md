# GERAN


GERAN is an abbreviation for GSM EDGE Radio Access Network. The
standards for GERAN are maintained by the 3GPP (Third Generation
Partnership Project). GERAN is a key part of GSM, and also of combined
UMTS/GSM networks.

GERAN is the radio part of GSM/EDGE together with the network that joins
the base stations (the Ater and Abis interfaces) and the base station
controllers (A interfaces, etc.) The network represents the core of a
GSM network, through which phone calls and packet data are routed from
and to the PSTN and Internet to and from subscriber handsets. A mobile
phone operator's network comprises one or more GERANs, coupled with
UTRANs in the case of a UMTS/GSM network.

A GERAN without EDGE is a GRAN, but is otherwise identical in concept.

A GERAN without GSM is an ERAN.\
