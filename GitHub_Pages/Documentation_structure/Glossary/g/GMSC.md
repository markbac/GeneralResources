# GMSC


Gateway Mobile Switching Centre

The Gateway Mobile Switching Centre (GMSC) is a special kind of MSC that
is used to route calls outside the mobile network. Whenever a call for a
mobile subscriber comes from outside the mobile network, or the
subscriber wants to make a call to somebody outside the mobile network
the call is routed through the GMSC.

In practice, the GMSC is just a function that can be part of a MSC.
