# GNU


GNU is an operating system and an extensive collection of computer
software. GNU is composed wholly of free software, most of which is
licensed under the GNU Project's own General Public License (GPL).

GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix!", chosen because GNU's
design is Unix-like, but differs from Unix by being free software and
containing no Unix code.The GNU project includes an operating system
kernel, GNU HURD, which was the original focus of the Free Software
Foundation (FSF). However, non-GNU kernels, most famously Linux, can
also be used with GNU software; as the Hurd kernel is not yet
production-ready,\[20\] this is how the GNU system is usually used.The
combination of GNU software and the Linux kernel is commonly known as
Linux (or less frequently GNU/Linux; see GNU/Linux naming controversy).
