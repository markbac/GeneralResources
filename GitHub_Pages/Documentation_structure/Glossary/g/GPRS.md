General Packet Radio Service

General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet oriented mobile data
standard on the 2G and 3G cellular communication network's global system
for mobile communications (GSM). GPRS was established by European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in response to the earlier
CDPD and i-mode packet-switched cellular technologies. It is now
maintained by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

GPRS is typically sold according to the total volume of data transferred
during the billing cycle, in contrast with circuit switched data, which
is usually billed per minute of connection time, or sometimes by
one-third minute increments. Usage above the GPRS bundled data cap may
be charged per Mb of data, speed limited, or disallowed.

GPRS is a best-effort service, implying variable throughput and latency
that depend on the number of other users sharing the service
concurrently, as opposed to circuit switching, where a certain quality
of service (QoS) is guaranteed during the connection. In 2G systems,
GPRS provides data rates of 56--114 kbit/sec.Â 2G cellular technology
combined with GPRS is sometimes described as 2.5G, that is, a technology
between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony.
It provides moderate-speed data transfer, by using unused time division
multiple access (TDMA) channels in, for example, the GSM system. GPRS is
integrated into GSM Release 97 and newer releases.\
