# GSM


GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) is a standard developed by
the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe
the protocols for second-generation digital cellular networks used by
mobile devices such as tablets. It was first deployed in Finland in
December 1991. As of 2014, it has become the global standard for mobile
communications -- with over 90% market share, operating in over 193
countries and territories.

2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog
cellular networks, and the GSM standard originally described a digital,
circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony. This
expanded over time to include data communications, first by
circuit-switched transport, then by packet data transport via GPRS
(General Packet Radio Services) and EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM
Evolution, or EGPRS).

Subsequently, the 3GPP developed third-generation (3G) UMTS standards,
followed by fourth-generation (4G) LTE Advanced standards, which do not
form part of the ETSI GSM standard.\
