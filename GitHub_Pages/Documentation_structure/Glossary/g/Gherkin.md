# Gherkin


Gherkin is a language that developers use to define tests. Since this
language uses plain English, it's meant to describe use cases for a
software system in a way that can be read and understood by almost
anyone.

This syntax promotes behavior-driven development (BDD) because it allows
developers, managers, business analysts and other parties involved to
understand the requirements of the project and the life-cycle.

The language makes it easy to create simple documentation of the code
that's being written.  Gherkin also provides scripts for test automation
and supports dozens of languages.

The primary keywords are:

- `Feature`

- `Rule` (as of Gherkin 6)

- `Example` (or `Scenario`)

- `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, `But` for steps (or `*`)

- `Background`

- `Scenario Outline` (or `Scenario Template`)

- `Examples` (or `Scenarios`)
