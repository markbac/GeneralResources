# Go


Go (often referred to as Golang) is a programming language created by
Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is a
statically typed, compiled language in the tradition of C, with memory
safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style
concurrency. The compiler, tools and source code are all free and open
source.
