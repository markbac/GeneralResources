Gang of Four Design patterns

Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software is a
software engineering book describing software design patterns. The
book's authors are Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John
Vlissides with a foreword by Grady Booch. The book is divided into two
parts, with the first two chapters exploring the capabilities and
pitfalls of object-oriented programming, and the remaining chapters
describing 23 classic software design patterns. The book includes
examples in C++ and Smalltalk.

It has been influential to the field of software engineering and is
regarded as an important source for object-oriented design theory and
practice. More than 500,000 copies have been sold in English and in 13
other languages. The authors are often referred to as the Gang of Four
(GoF).
