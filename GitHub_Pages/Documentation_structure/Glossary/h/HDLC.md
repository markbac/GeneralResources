# HDLC


High-Level Datalink Control

High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a bit-oriented code-transparent
synchronous data link layer protocol developed by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO). The original ISO standards for
HDLC are as follows:

ISO 3309-1979 -- Frame Structure\
ISO 4335-1979 -- Elements of Procedure\
ISO 6159-1980 -- Unbalanced Classes of Procedure\
ISO 6256-1981 -- Balanced Classes of Procedure\
The current standard for HDLC is ISO/IEC 13239:2002, which replaces all
of those standards.

HDLC provides both connection-oriented and connectionless service.

HDLC can be used for point-to-multipoint connections via the original
master-slave modes Normal Response Mode (NRM) and Asynchronous Response
Mode (ARM), but they are now rarely used; is now used almost exclusively
to connect one device to another, using Asynchronous Balanced Mode
(ABM).
