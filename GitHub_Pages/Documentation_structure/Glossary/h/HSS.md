Home subscriber server

The home subscriber server (HSS), or user profile server function
(UPSF), is a master user database that supports the IMS network entities
that actually handle calls. It contains the subscription-related
information (subscriber profiles), performs authentication and
authorization of the user, and can provide information about the
subscriber's location and IP information. It is similar to the GSM home
location register (HLR) and Authentication centre (AuC).\
