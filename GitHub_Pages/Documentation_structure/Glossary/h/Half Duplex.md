# Half Duplex


In a half-duplex system, both parties can communicate with each other,
but not simultaneously; the communication is one direction at a time. An
example of a half-duplex device is a walkie-talkie two-way radio that
has a "push-to-talk" button; when the local user wants to speak to the
remote person they push this button, which turns on the transmitter but
turns off the receiver, so they cannot hear the remote person. To listen
to the other person they release the button, which turns on the receiver
but turns off the transmitter.
