# ICE


Interactive Connectivity Establishment

Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a technique used in
computer networking to find ways for two computers to talk to each other
as directly as possible in peer-to-peer networking. This is most
commonly used for interactive media such as Voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP), peer-to-peer communications, video, and instant messaging. In
such applications, you want to avoid communicating through a central
server (which would slow down communication, and be expensive), but
direct communication between client applications on the Internet is very
tricky due to network address translators (NATs), firewalls, and other
network barriers.

ICE is developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force MMUSIC working
group and is published as RFC 5245, which has obsoleted RFC 4091
