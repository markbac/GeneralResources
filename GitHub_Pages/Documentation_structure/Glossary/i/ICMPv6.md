# ICMPv6


Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (for IPv6)

Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) is the
implementation of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). ICMPv6 is defined in RFC 4443.\[1\]
ICMPv6 is an integral part of IPv6 and performs error reporting and
diagnostic functions (e.g., ping), and has a framework for extensions to
implement future changes.

Several extensions have been published, defining new ICMPv6 message
types as well as new options for existing ICMPv6 message types. Neighbor
Discovery Protocol (NDP) is a node discovery protocol in IPv6 which
replaces and enhances functions of ARP.\[2\] Secure Neighbor Discovery
(SEND) is an extension of NDP with extra security. Multicast Listener
Discovery (MLD) is used by IPv6 routers for discovering multicast
listeners on a directly attached link, much like Internet Group
Management Protocol (IGMP) is used in IPv4. Multicast Router Discovery
(MRD) allows discovery of multicast routers.
