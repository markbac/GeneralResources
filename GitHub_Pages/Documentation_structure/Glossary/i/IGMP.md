# IGMP


The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is a communications
protocol used by hosts and adjacent routers on IPv4 networks to
establish multicast group memberships. IGMP is an integral part of IP
multicast.

IGMP can be used for one-to-many networking applications such as online
streaming video and gaming, and allows more efficient use of resources
when supporting these types of applications.

IGMP is used on IPv4 networks. Multicast management on IPv6 networks is
handled by Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) which is a part of ICMPv6
in contrast to IGMP's bare IP encapsulation.\
