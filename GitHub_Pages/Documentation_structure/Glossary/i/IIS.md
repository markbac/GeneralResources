Internet Information Services

Internet Information Services (IIS, formerly Internet Information
Server) is an extensible web server created by Microsoft for use with
the Windows NT family. IIS supports HTTP, HTTP/2, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP
and NNTP. It has been an integral part of the Windows NT family since
Windows NT 4.0, though it may be absent from some editions (e.g.Â Windows
XP Home edition), and is not active by default.
