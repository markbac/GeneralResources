# IKE


Internet Key Exchange

In computing, Internet Key Exchange (IKE, sometimes IKEv1 or IKEv2,
depending on version) is the protocol used to set up a security
association (SA) in the IPsec protocol suite. IKE builds upon the Oakley
protocol and ISAKMP. IKE uses X.509 certificates for authentication ‒
either pre-shared or distributed using DNS (preferably with DNSSEC) and
a Diffie--Hellman key exchange ‒ to set up a shared session secret from
which cryptographic keys are derived. In addition, a security policy for
every peer which will connect must be manually maintained.\
