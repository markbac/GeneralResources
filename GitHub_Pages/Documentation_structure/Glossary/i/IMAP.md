# IMAP


Internet Message Access Protocol

In computing, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet
standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from
a mail server over a TCP/IP connection. IMAP is defined by RFC 3501.

IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an
email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave
messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. An IMAP
server typically listens on port number 143. IMAP over SSL (IMAPS) is
assigned the port number 993.

Virtually all modern e-mail clients and servers support IMAP. IMAP and
the earlier POP3 (Post Office Protocol) are the two most prevalent
standard protocols for email retrieval, with many webmail service
providers such as Gmail, Outlook.com and Yahoo! Mail also providing
support for either IMAP or POP3.
