# IOS cisco OS


Cisco IOS (originally Internetwork Operating System) is a family of
software used on most Cisco Systems routers and current Cisco network
switches. (Earlier switches ran CatOS.) IOS is a package of routing,
switching, internetworking and telecommunications functions integrated
into a multitasking operating system. Although the IOS code base
includes a cooperative multitasking kernel, most IOS features have been
ported to other kernels such as QNX and Linux for use in Cisco products
or simulators such as Cisco VIRL.
