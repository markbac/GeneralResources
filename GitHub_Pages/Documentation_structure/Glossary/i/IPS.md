Intrusion Prevention Services

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application
that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy
violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported
either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security
information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines
outputs from multiple sources, and uses alarm filtering techniques to
distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.

While there are several types of IDS, ranging in scope from single
computers to large networks,\[1\]. the most common classifications are
network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion
detection systems (HIDS). A system that monitors important operating
system files is an example of a HIDS, while a system that analyzes
incoming network traffic is an example of a NIDS. It is also possible to
classify IDS by detection approach: the most well-known variants are
signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware)
and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of "good"
traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Some IDS have the
ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response
capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention
system.
