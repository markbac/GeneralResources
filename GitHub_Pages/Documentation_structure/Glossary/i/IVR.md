# IVR


Interactive voice response (IVR) is a technology that allows a computer
to interact with humans through the use of voice and DTMF tones input
via a keypad. In telecommunications, IVR allows customers to interact
with a company's host system via a telephone keypad or by speech
recognition, after which services can be inquired about through the IVR
dialogue. IVR systems can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically
generated audio to further direct users on how to proceed. IVR systems
deployed in the network are sized to handle large call volumes and also
used for outbound calling, as IVR systems are more intelligent than many
predictive dialer systems
