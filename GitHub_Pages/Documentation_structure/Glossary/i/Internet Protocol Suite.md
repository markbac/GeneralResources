# Internet Protocol Suite


The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of
communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer
networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational
protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and
the Internet Protocol (IP). It is occasionally known as the Department
of Defense (DoD) model because the development of the networking method
was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.

The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication
specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted,
routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four
abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to
the scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, the layers are
the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains
within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing
internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer,
handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer,
providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.

Technical standards specifying the Internet protocol suite and many of
its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). The Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a
more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.\
