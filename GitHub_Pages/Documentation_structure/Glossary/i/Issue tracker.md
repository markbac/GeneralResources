# Issue tracker


An issue tracking system (also ITS, trouble ticket system, support
ticket, request management or incident ticket system) is a computer
software package that manages and maintains lists of issues, as needed
by an organization. Issue tracking systems are commonly used in an
organization's customer support call center to create, update, and
resolve reported customer issues, or even issues reported by that
organization's other employees. A support ticket should include vital
information for the account involved and the issue encountered. An issue
tracking system often also contains a knowledge base containing
information on each customer, resolutions to common problems, and other
such data. An issue tracking system is similar to a "bugtracker", and
often, a software company will sell both, and some bugtrackers are
capable of being used as an issue tracking system, and vice versa.
Consistent use of an issue or bug tracking system is considered one of
the "hallmarks of a good software team".

A ticket element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report
on a particular problem, its status, and other relevant data. They are
commonly created in a help desk or call center environment and almost
always have a unique reference number, also known as a case, issue or
call log number which is used to allow the user or help staff to quickly
locate, add to or communicate the status of the user's issue or request.
