# Issue


Something that needs to be resolved.\
An *issue* is a catch-all term for a unit of work that will impact the
project if not addressed, and which is not captured by project planning
(work planning, scheduling, etc.) or a formally identified change,
defect, or risk. Issues are a type of *corrective activity
management* item.
