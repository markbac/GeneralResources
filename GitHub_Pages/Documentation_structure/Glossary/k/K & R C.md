# K & R C


In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition
of The C Programming Language. This book, known to C programmers as
"K&R", served for many years as an informal specification of the
language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as
K&R C. The second edition of the book covers the later ANSI C standard,
described below.
