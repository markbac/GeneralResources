# KPI


Key Performance Indicator

A performance indicator or key performance indicator (KPI) is a type of
performance measurement. KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or
of a particular activity (such as projects, programs, products and other
initiatives) in which it engages.

Often success is simply the repeated, periodic achievement of some
levels of operational goal (e.g. zero defects, 10/10 customer
satisfaction, etc.), and sometimes success is defined in terms of making
progress toward strategic goals. Accordingly, choosing the right KPIs
relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the
organization.\[citation needed\] What is deemed important often depends
on the department measuring the performance -- e.g. the KPIs useful to
finance will differ from the KPIs assigned to sales.

Since there is a need to understand well what is important, various
techniques to assess the present state of the business, and its key
activities, are associated with the selection of performance indicators.
These assessments often lead to the identification of potential
improvements, so performance indicators are routinely associated with
'performance improvement' initiatives. A very common way to choose KPIs
is to apply a management framework such as the balanced scorecard.
