# Kerberos


Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol that works on the
basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network
to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. The protocol
was named after the character Kerberos (or Cerberus) from Greek
mythology, the ferocious three-headed guard dog of Hades. Its designers
aimed it primarily at a client--server model and it provides mutual
authentication---both the user and the server verify each other's
identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping
and replay attacks.

Kerberos builds on symmetric key cryptography and requires a trusted
third party, and optionally may use public-key cryptography during
certain phases of authentication. Kerberos uses UDP port 88 by default.
