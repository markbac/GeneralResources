Layer 3 Virtual Private Network

Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (l3vpn): L3VPN is a technology based on
PE. It uses MPLS to forward VPN packets over service provider backbones.

L3VPN comprises the following types of devices:

Customer edge (CE) device---A CE resides on a customer network and has
one or more interfaces directly connected to service provider networks.
It can be a router, a switch, or a host.

- Provider edge (PE) device---A PE resides at the edge of a service
    provider network and connects one or more CEs. On an MPLS network,
    all VPN services are processed on the PEs.

- Provider (P) device---A P device is a core device on a service
    provider network. It is not directly connected to any CE. It has
    only basic MPLS forwarding capability.
