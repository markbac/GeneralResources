# LAG


Link Aggregation Group

In computer networking, the term link aggregation applies to various
methods of combining (aggregating) multiple network connections in
parallel in order to increase throughput beyond what a single connection
could sustain, and to provide redundancy in case one of the links should
fail. A Link Aggregation Group (LAG) combines a number of physical ports
together to make a single high-bandwidth data path, so as to implement
the traffic load sharing among the member ports in the group and to
enhance the connection reliability.
