Least Cost Routing

In voice telecommunications, least-cost routing (LCR) is the process of
selecting the path of outbound communications traffic based on cost.
Within a telecoms carrier, an LCR team might periodically (monthly,
weekly or even daily) choose between routes from several or even
hundreds of carriers for destinations across the world. This function
might also be automated by a device or software program known as a
"Least Cost Router."
