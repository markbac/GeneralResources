# Lifecycle


A model of all *activities* between the initial idea for a *system* and
its last use, often heavily focused on the creation of the *system* as
part of a project. Lifecycles are quite varied, but normally
separate *activities* into *phases* that reflect progression of time
and/or grouping of similar activities. Projects select and customize
lifecycles to define ordering and optimize performance of *activities* .
