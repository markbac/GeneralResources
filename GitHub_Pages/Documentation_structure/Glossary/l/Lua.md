# Lua


Lua is a lightweight, multi-paradigm programming language designed
primarily for embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform, since
the interpreter is written in ANSI C, and has a relatively simple C API.

Lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software
applications to meet the increasing demand for customization at the
time. It provided the basic facilities of most procedural programming
languages, but more complicated or domain-specific features were not
included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language,
allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was intended to
be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused
on improving its speed, portability, extensibility, and ease-of-use in
development.
