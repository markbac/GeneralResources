# M2M


Machine to machine

Machine to machine (commonly abbreviated as M2M) refers to direct
communication between devices using any communications channel,
including wired and wireless. Machine to machine communication can
include industrial instrumentation, enabling a sensor or meter to
communicate the data it records (such as temperature, inventory level,
etc.) to application software that can use it (for example, adjusting an
industrial process based on temperature or placing orders to replenish
inventory). Such communication was originally accomplished by having a
remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for
analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal
computer.

More recent machine to machine communication has changed into a system
of networks that transmits data to personal appliances. The expansion of
IP networks around the world has made machine to machine communication
quicker and easier while using less power. These networks also allow new
business opportunities for consumers and suppliers.
