# MAC Flooding


In computer networking, a media access control attack or MAC flooding is
a technique employed to compromise the security of network switches. The
attack works by forcing legitimate MAC table contents out of the switch
and forcing a unicast flooding behavior potentially sending sensitive
information to portions of the network where it is not normally intended
to go.
