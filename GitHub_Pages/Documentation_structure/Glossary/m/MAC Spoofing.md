# MAC Spoofing


MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access
Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. The
MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC)
cannot be changed. However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be
changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an operating
system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing.
The process of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing.
Essentially, MAC spoofing entails changing a computer's identity, for
any reason, and it is relatively easy.
