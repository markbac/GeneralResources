Metropolitan Area Network

A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a \[computer network\] that
interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic area or
region larger than that covered by even a large local area network (LAN)
but smaller than the area covered by a wide area network (WAN). The term
MAN is applied to the interconnection of networks in a city into a
single larger network which may then also offer efficient connection to
a wide area network.It is also used to mean the interconnection of
several local area networks in a metropolitan area through the use of
point-to-point connections between them. The latter usage is also
sometimes referred to as a campus network.\
