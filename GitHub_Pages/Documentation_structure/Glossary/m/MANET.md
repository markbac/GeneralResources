# MANET


Mobile Adhoc NETwork

A mobile ad hoc network (MANET), also known as wireless ad hoc network
or ad hoc wireless network, is a continuously self-configuring,
infrastructure-less network of mobile devices connected wirelessly.

Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction,
and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. Each
must forward traffic unrelated to its own use, and therefore be a
router. The primary challenge in building a MANET is equipping each
device to continuously maintain the information required to properly
route traffic.\[4\] Such networks may operate by themselves or may be
connected to the larger Internet. They may contain one or multiple and
different transceivers between nodes. This results in a highly dynamic,
autonomous topology.

MANETs are a kind of wireless ad hoc network (WANET) that usually has a
routable networking environment on top of a Link Layer ad hoc network.
MANETs consist of a peer-to-peer, self-forming, self-healing network.
MANETs circa 2000--2015 typically communicate at radio frequencies (30
MHz -- 5 GHz).\
