Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services

Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (MBMS) is a point-to-multipoint
interface specification for existing and upcoming 3GPP cellular
networks, which is designed to provide efficient delivery of broadcast
and multicast services, both within a cell as well as within the core
network. For broadcast transmission across multiple cells, it defines
transmission via single-frequency network configurations. The
specification is referred to as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast
Services (eMBMS) when transmissions are delivered through an LTE (Long
Term Evolution) network. eMBMS is also known as LTE Broadcast.

Target applications include mobile TV and radio broadcasting, live
streaming video services, as well as file delivery and emergency alerts.
