Matter Beyond Our Reasonable Control

MBORC is a contractual provision contained in all Openreach contracts
which releases Openreach from liability under the relevant product terms
and conditions in circumstances where the following criteria apply to
our failure to perform the contract:

- The cause of the incident is beyond our reasonable control and

- The fix to remedy within contractual timescales is also beyond our
    reasonable control.

    Examples of MBORC situations are:

- Network attacks, i.e.Â criminal damage to network apparatus

- BT plant damaged by non-BT contractors

- a PCP or pole being knocked over or damaged in a traffic accident

- damage caused by exceptionally severe weather, eg floods or storm
