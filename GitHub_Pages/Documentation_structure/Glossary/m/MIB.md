# MIB


management information base

A management information base (MIB) is a database used for managing the
entities in a communication network. Most often associated with the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the term is also used more
generically in contexts such as in OSI/ISO Network management model.
While intended to refer to the complete collection of management
information available on an entity, it is often used to refer to a
particular subset, more correctly referred to as MIB-module.

Objects in the MIB are defined using a subset of Abstract Syntax
Notation One (ASN.1) called "Structure of Management Information Version
2 (SMIv2)" RFC 2578. The software that performs the parsing is a MIB
compiler.

The database is hierarchical (tree-structured) and each entry is
addressed through an object identifier (OID). Internet documentation
RFCs discuss MIBs, notably RFC 1155, "Structure and Identification of
Management Information for TCP/IP based internets", and its two
companions, RFC 1213, "Management Information Base for Network
Management of TCP/IP-based internets", and RFC 1157, "A Simple Network
Management Protocol".\
