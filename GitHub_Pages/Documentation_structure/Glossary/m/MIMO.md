# MIMO


multiple-input and multiple-output

In radio, , or MIMO, is a method for multiplying the capacity of a radio
link using multiple transmit and receive antennas to exploit multipath
propagation. MIMO has become an essential element of wireless
communication standards including IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.11ac
(Wi-Fi), HSPA+ (3G), WiMAX (4G), and Long Term Evolution (LTE 4G). More
recently, MIMO has been applied to power-line communication for 3-wire
installations as part of ITU [G.hn](http://g.hn/) standard and HomePlug
AV2 specification.

At one time, in wireless the term "MIMO" referred to the use of multiple
antennas at the transmitter and the receiver. In modern usage, "MIMO"
specifically refers to a practical technique for sending and receiving
more than one data signal simultaneously over the same radio channel by
exploiting multipath propagation. MIMO is fundamentally different from
smart antenna techniques developed to enhance the performance of a
single data signal, such as beamforming and diversity.\
