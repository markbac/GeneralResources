Bayonet Neill--Concelman

The BNC (Bayonet Neill--Concelman) connector is a miniature quick
connect/disconnect radio frequency connector used for coaxial cable. It
features two bayonet lugs on the female connector; mating is fully
achieved with a quarter turn of the coupling nut. BNC connectors are
used with miniature-to-subminiature coaxial cable in radio, television,
and other radio-frequency electronic equipment, test instruments, and
video signals. The BNC was commonly used for early computer networks,
including ARCnet, the IBM PC Network, and the 10BASE2 variant of
Ethernet. BNC connectors are made to match the characteristic impedance
of cable at either 50 ohms or 75 ohms. They are usually applied for
frequencies below 4 GHz\[ and voltages below 500 volts.
