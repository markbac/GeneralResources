Multi-Service Access Node

A multi-service access node (MSAN), also known as a multi-service access
gateway (MSAG), is a device typically installed in a telephone exchange
(although sometimes in a roadside serving area interface cabinet) which
connects customers' telephone lines to the core network, to provide
telephone, ISDN, and broadband such as DSL all from a single platform.\
