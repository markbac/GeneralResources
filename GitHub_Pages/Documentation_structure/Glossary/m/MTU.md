# MTU


In computer networking, the maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size
of the largest protocol data unit (PDU) that can be communicated in a
single network layer transaction. The MTU relates to, but is not
identical to the maximum frame size that can be transported on the data
link layer, e.g.Â Ethernet frame.

Larger MTU is associated with reduced overhead. Smaller MTU values can
reduce network delay. In many cases, MTU is dependent on underlying
network capabilities and must be adjusted manually or automatically so
as to not exceed these capabilities. MTU parameters may appear in
association with a communications interface or standard. Some systems
may decide MTU at connect time.
