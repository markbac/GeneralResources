# Management Plane


In computer networking, the management plane of a networking device is
the element of a system that configures, monitors, and provides
management, monitoring and configuration services to, all layers of the
network stack and other parts of the system. It should be distinguished
from the control plane, which is primarily concerned with routing table
and forwarding information base computation.

In system diagrams, the management plane is typically shown in three
dimensions as overlapping the network stack, separated by a dimension
that delineates the power plane, data plane, control plane and
management plane.
