# NTP


Network Time Protocol

Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock
synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched,
variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is
one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by
David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.

NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a
few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\[1\]:3 It uses the
intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo's algorithm, to
select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of
variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens
of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than
one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions.
Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or
more
