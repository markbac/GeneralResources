# NTS


Number Translation Service

A number translation service translates a dialled telephone number,
typically beginning 08 in the UK to a geographical 'connect number'
beginning 01 or 02 in the UK. The connect number may be changed without
changing the published dialled number. Originally NTS numbers were used,
for example, to allow any caller to dial a local call to the called
party irrespective of location, saving money if the connect number was
not also a local call, but the system gradually came to be seen as a way
of making money and now most phone companies charge the caller more for
08 numbers than for 01, 02 or 03 numbers.
