Network Termination Unit

In telecommunications, a network interface device (NID; also known by
several other names) is a device that serves as the demarcation point
between the carrier's local loop and the customer's premises wiring.
Outdoor telephone NIDs also provide the subscriber with access to the
station wiring and serve as a convenient test point for verification of
loop integrity and of the subscriber's inside wiring.
