Network as a Service

Network as a service (NaaS) describes services for network transport
connectivity. NaaS involves the optimization of resource allocations by
considering network and computing resources as a unified whole

The term "Network as a service" (NaaS) is often used along with other
marketing terms like cloud computing, along with acronyms such as
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS),
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Communication-as-a-Service (CaaS).

NaaS sometimes includes the provision of a virtual network service by
the owners of the network infrastructure to a third party. Often this
includes network virtualization using a protocol such as OpenFlow.

Some service models are:

- Virtual Private Network (VPN): Extends a private network and the
    resources contained in the network across networks like the public
    Internet. It enables a host computer to send and receive data across
    shared or public networks as if it were a private network with the
    functionality and policies of the private network.
- Bandwidth on demand (BoD): Technique by which network capacity is
    assigned based on requirements between different nodes or users.
    Under this model link rates can be dynamically adapted to the
    traffic demands of the nodes connected to the link.
- Mobile network virtualization: Model in which a telecommunications
    manufacturer or independent network operator builds and operates a
    network (wireless, or transport connectivity) and sells its
    communication access capabilities to third parties (commonly mobile
    phone operators) charging by capacity utilization. A mobile virtual
    network operator (MVNO), is a mobile communications services
    provider that does not own the radio spectrum or wireless network
    infrastructure over which it provides services. Commonly a MVNO
    offers its communication services using the network infrastructure
    of an established mobile network operator.
