Optical Spectrum Access Filter Connect

Openreach virtual dark fibre service that provides CPs all the key
benefits of dark fibre -- like the freedom to control and increase
bandwidth usage at no extra cost -- without compromising on service and
maintenance levels.

It works by enabling CPs to operate their own network electronics on top
of a managed connection which Openreach can monitor 24/7 and provide
rapid response and repair times over.\
