# OSPF


Open Shortest Path First

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet
Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and
falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating
within a single autonomous system (AS). It is defined as OSPF Version 2
in RFC 2328 (1998) for IPv4. The updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF
Version 3 in RFC 5340 (2008). OSPF supports the Classless Inter-Domain
Routing (CIDR) addressing model.

OSPF is a widely used IGP in large enterprise networks. IS-IS, another
LSR-based protocol, is more common in large service provider networks.
