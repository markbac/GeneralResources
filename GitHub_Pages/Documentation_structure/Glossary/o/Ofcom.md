# Ofcom


The Office of Communications, commonly known as Ofcom, is the UK
government-approved regulatory and competition authority for the
broadcasting, telecommunications and postal industries of the United
Kingdom.

Ofcom has wide-ranging powers across the television, radio, telecoms and
postal sectors. It has a statutory duty to represent the interests of
citizens and consumers by promoting competition and protecting the
public from harmful or offensive material.

Some of the main areas Ofcom presides over are licensing, research,
codes and policies, complaints, competition and protecting the radio
spectrum from abuse (e.g.Â pirate radio stations).

The regulator was initially established by the Office of Communications
Act 2002 and received its full authority from the Communications Act
2003.
