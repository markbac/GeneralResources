# PAP


Password Authentication Protocol

Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is a password-based
authentication protocol used by Point to Point Protocol (PPP) to
validate users. Almost all network operating system remote servers
support PAP.

PAP is considered a weak authentication scheme (weak schemes are simple
and have lighter computational overhead but are much more vulnerable to
attack; while weak schemes may have limited application in some
constrained environments, they are avoided in general). Among PAP's
deficiencies is the fact that it transmits unencrypted passwords over
the network. PAP is therefore used only as a last resort when the remote
server does not support a stronger scheme such as CHAP or EAP
