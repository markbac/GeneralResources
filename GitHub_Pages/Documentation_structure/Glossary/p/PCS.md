Physical Coding Sub-layer

The Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) is a networking protocol sublayer in
the Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet standards.
It resides at the top of the physical layer (PHY), and provides an
interface between the Physical Medium Attachment (PMA) sublayer and the
Media Independent Interface (MII). It is responsible for data encoding
and decoding, scrambling and descrambling, alignment marker insertion
and removal, block and symbol redistribution, and lane block
synchronization and deskew.
