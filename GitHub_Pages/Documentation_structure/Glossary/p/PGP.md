Pretty Good Privacy

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides
cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is
used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files,
directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of
e-mail communications. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.

PGP and similar software follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC
4880) for encrypting and decrypting data.
