# PHP


PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a server-side scripting
language designed for Web development, but also used as a
general-purpose programming language. It was originally created by
Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced
by The PHP Group.\[6\] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but
it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in
combination with various web template systems, web content management
systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP
interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common
Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results
of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data,
including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be
executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to
implement standalone graphical applications.

The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free
software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and
can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and
platform, free of charge.

The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or
standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de
facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014
work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.
