PPP over Ethernet

The Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) is a network protocol
for encapsulating PPP frames inside Ethernet frames. It appeared in
1999, in the context of the boom of DSL as the solution for tunneling
packets over the DSL connection to the ISP's IP network, and from there
to the rest of the Internet. A 2005 networking book noted that "Most DSL
providers use PPPoE, which provides authentication, encryption, and
compression." Typical use of PPPoE involves leveraging the PPP
facilities for authenticating the user with a username and password,
predominately via the PAP protocol and less often via CHAP.
