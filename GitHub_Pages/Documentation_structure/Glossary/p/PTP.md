# PTP


Precision Time Protocol

The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize
clocks throughout a computer network. On a local area network, it
achieves clock accuracy in the sub-microsecond range, making it suitable
for measurement and control systems.

PTP was originally defined in the IEEE 1588-2002 standard, officially
entitled "Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for
Networked Measurement and Control Systems" and published in 2002. In
2008, IEEE 1588-2008 was released as a revised standard; also known as
PTP Version 2, it improves accuracy, precision and robustness but is not
backward compatible with the original 2002 version.

"IEEE 1588 is designed to fill a niche not well served by either of the
two dominant protocols, NTP and GPS. IEEE 1588 is designed for local
systems requiring accuracies beyond those attainable using NTP. It is
also designed for applications that cannot bear the cost of a GPS
receiver at each node, or for which GPS signals are inaccessible."
