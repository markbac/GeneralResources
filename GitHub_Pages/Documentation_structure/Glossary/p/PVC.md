Permanent Virtual Circuit

A permanent virtual circuit (PVC) is a virtual circuit established for
repeated/continuous use between the same DTE. In a PVC, the long-term
association is identical to the data transfer phase of a virtual call.
Permanent virtual circuits eliminate the need for repeated call set-up
and clearing. Frame relay is typically used to provide PVCs.
