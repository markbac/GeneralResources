# Pascal


Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language, which
Niklaus Wirth designed in 1968--69 and published in 1970, as a small,
efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices
using structured programming and data structuring. It is named in honor
of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal.

Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language. Wirth had
already developed several improvements to this language as part of the
ALGOL X proposals, but these were not accepted and Pascal was developed
separately and released in 1970. A derivative known as Object Pascal
designed for object-oriented programming was developed in 1985; this was
used by Apple Computer and Borland in the late 1980s and later developed
into Delphi on the Microsoft Windows platform. Extensions to the Pascal
concepts led to the Pascal-like languages Modula-2 and Oberon
