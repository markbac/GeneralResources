# Preview


An *engineering discussion* where materials have been prepared ahead of
time for review and discussion in a meeting. The goal is to probe
proposed solution to detect *defects* and suggest alternatives.\
*Previews* differ from *reviews* in that they are solution oriented
rather than detection oriented.
