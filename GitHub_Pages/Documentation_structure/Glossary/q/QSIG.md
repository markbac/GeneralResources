# QSIG


QSIG is an ISDN based signaling protocol for signaling between private
branch exchanges (PBXs) in a private integrated services network (PISN).
It makes use of the connection-level Q.931 protocol and the
application-level ROSE protocol. ISDN "proper" functions as the physical
link layer.

QSIG was originally developed by Ecma International, adopted by ETSI and
is defined by a set of ISO standard documents, so is not owned by any
company. This allows interoperability between communications platforms
provided by disparate vendors.

QSIG has two layers, called BC (basic call) and GF (generic function).
QSIG BC describes how to set up calls between PBXs. QSIG GF provides
supplementary services for large-scale corporate, educational, and
government networks, such as line identification, call intrusion and
call forwarding. Thus for a large or very distributed company that
requires multiple PBXs, users can receive the same services across the
network and be unaware of the switch that their telephone is connected
to. This greatly eases the problems of management of large networks.
