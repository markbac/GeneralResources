# R Language


R is a programming language and free software
environment for statistical computing and graphics that is supported by
the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely
used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical
software and data analysis. Polls, surveys of data miners, and studies
of scholarly literature databases show that R's popularity has increased
substantially in recent years. As of June 2018, R ranks 10th in the
TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages.
