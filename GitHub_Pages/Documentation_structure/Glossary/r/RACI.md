# RACI


Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed

A responsibility assignment matrix (RAM), also known as RACI matrix or
linear responsibility chart (LRC), describes the participation by
various roles in completing tasks or deliverables for a project or
business process. It is especially useful in clarifying roles and
responsibilities in cross-functional/departmental projects and
processes.\
