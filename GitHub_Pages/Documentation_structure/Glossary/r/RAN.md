# RAN


radio access network

A radio access network (RAN) is part of a mobile telecommunication
system. It implements a radio access technology. Conceptually, it
resides between a device such as a mobile phone, a computer, or any
remotely controlled machine and provides connection with its core
network (CN). Depending on the standard, mobile phones and other
wireless connected devices are varyingly known as user equipment (UE),
terminal equipment, mobile station (MS), etc. RAN functionality is
typically provided by a silicon chip residing in both the core network
as well as the user equipment.

Examples of radio access network types are:

- GRAN: GSM radio access network

- GERAN: essentially the same as GRAN but specifying the inclusion of
    EDGE packet radio services

- UTRAN: UMTS radio access network

- E-UTRAN: The Long Term Evolution (LTE) high speed and low latency
    radio access network

    It is also possible for a single handset/phone to be simultaneously
    connected to multiple radio access networks. Handsets capable of
    this are sometimes called dual-mode handsets. For instance it is
    common for handsets to support both GSM and UMTS (a.k.a. "3G") radio
    access technologies. Such devices seamlessly transfer an ongoing
    call between different radio access networks without the user
    noticing any disruption in service.\
