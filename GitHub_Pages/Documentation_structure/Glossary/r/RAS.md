Registration, Admission, and Status

Registration, admission, and status (RAS) is a component of a network
protocol that involves the addition of (or refusal to add) new
authorized users, the admission of (or refusal to admit) authorized
users based on available bandwidth, and the tracking of the status of
all users. Formally, RAS is part of the H.225 protocol for H.323
communications networks, designed to support multimedia bandwidths. RAS
is an important signalling component in networks using voice over IP
(VoIP).
