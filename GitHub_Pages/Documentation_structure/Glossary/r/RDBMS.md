relational database management system

A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management
system (DBMS) based on the relational model invented by Edgar F. Codd at
IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. Most databases in widespread use
today are based on his relational database model.

RDBMSs have been a common choice for the storage of information in
databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical
information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s.
Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases
and network databases because they were easier to implement and
administer. Nonetheless, relational databases received continued,
unsuccessful challenges by object database management systems in the
1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the
so-called object-relational impedance mismatch between relational
databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by XML
database management systems in the 1990s. However, due to the expanse of
technologies, such as horizontal scaling of computer clusters, NoSQL
databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS
databases\
