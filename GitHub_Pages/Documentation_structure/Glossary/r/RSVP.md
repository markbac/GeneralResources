Resource Reservation Protocol

The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is a transport layer protocol
designed to reserve resources across a network for quality of service
(QoS) using the integrated services model. RSVP operates over an IPv4 or
IPv6 and provides receiver-initiated setup of resource reservations for
multicast or unicast data flows. It does not transport application data
but is similar to a control protocol, like Internet Control Message
Protocol (ICMP) or Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). RSVP is
described in RFC 2205.

RSVP can be used by hosts and routers to request or deliver specific
levels of QoS for application data streams or flows. RSVP defines how
applications place reservations and how they can relinquish the reserved
resources once no longer required. RSVP operation will generally result
in resources being reserved in each node along a path. RSVP is not a
routing protocol and was designed to interoperate with current and
future routing protocols.

RSVP by itself is rarely deployed in telecommunications networks
today\[citation needed\] but, as of February 2003, the traffic
engineering extension of RSVP, or RSVP-TE, is becoming more widely
accepted nowadays in many QoS-oriented networks. Next Steps in Signaling
(NSIS) is a proposed replacement for RSVP.
