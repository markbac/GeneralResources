Real Time Streaming Protocol

The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol
designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control
streaming media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and
controlling media sessions between end points. Clients of media servers
issue VCR-style commands, such as play, record and pause, to facilitate
real-time control of the media streaming from the server to a client
(Video On Demand) or from a client to the server (Voice Recording).

The transmission of streaming data itself is not a task of RTSP. Most
RTSP servers use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in conjunction
with Real-time Control Protocol (RTCP) for media stream delivery.
