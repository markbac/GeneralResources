# Risk Reward Matric


A risk-reward analysis is a very simple tool which can help you assess
the risk and reward profile of completely different options. It works in
the same way as a risk-return analysis which you may already be familiar
with.\
It can be applied at any level, for example:

- by a CEO for comparing different strategic directions for the
    company.

- by a program manager deciding which projects to keep within the
    program and which to discard.

- by a project manager deciding how to sequence tasks

- or simply by an individual team member deciding how best to spend
    their day.

    The template works by having risk plotted along one axis and reward
    along the other. In the diagram below I've divided the template into
    four sections to show you how to interpret the information.

    The four categories from the diagram above are as follows:

    Equal Low: where risk and reward are both proportional and low.\
    Equal High: where risk and reward are both proportional and high.\
    Positive: represents a positive risk-reward balance, where a higher
    return can be achieved with limited risk.\
    Negative: represents a negative risk-reward balance, where a low
    return is the reward for taking on a relatively high risk.\
    How to Use it\
    First, you need to create a list of all the different options and
    their possible rewards. This can done quickly and roughly, or can
    involve serious effort (market research, scenario development etc)
    -- the effort you put in will depend on the size of the decision you
    are making. Examples of some options might include: outsourcing
    non-core activities, stop investing in poorly performing product
    lines, invest in new products, or investing to move into new
    markets. Once you have all the options and their potential reward,
    they should be plotted on the risk-reward chart:\

    At this stage some options will appear to have a more favourable
    risk-reward profile than others, such as outsourcing in the above
    example, but it is work taking the time to investigate whether any
    options can have their risks mitigated, or if there are options that
    can have their rewards boosted, before making a final decision on
    which option to go with. In the above example, if the risk of
    developing new products could be mitigated somehow then that option
    would become more favourable than outsourcing.

    Finally, for an even more complete picture to further aid our
    decision making, we can add resources to the risk-reward template.
    In the diagram below, the bigger the bubble the more resources are
    required to execute that option.\

    With risk, reward, and resources all plotted, we are able to trade
    them against one another to find the best option for us. From the
    diagram above you can see that outsourcing is probably the most
    favourable option, providing plenty of upside reward but requiring
    minimal resource and having little risk. Additionally, with so few
    resources engaged in making the outsourcing happen, perhaps some
    investigative work can start on the new product development option
    with some of the spare resource.
