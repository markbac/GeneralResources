# Ruby on rails


Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework
written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a
model--view--controller (MVC) framework, providing default
structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages
and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data
transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing.
In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known
software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over
configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record
pattern.
