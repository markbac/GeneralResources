# SC-FDMA


Single-carrier FDMA

Single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) is a frequency-division multiple access
scheme. It is also called Linearly precoded OFDMA (LP-OFDMA). Like other
multiple access schemes (TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, OFDMA), it deals with the
assignment of multiple users to a shared communication resource. SC-FDMA
can be interpreted as a linearly precoded OFDMA scheme, in the sense
that it has an additional DFT processing step preceding the conventional
OFDMA processing.\
SC-FDMA has drawn great attention as an attractive alternative to OFDMA,
especially in the uplink communications where lower peak-to-average
power ratio (PAPR) greatly benefits the mobile terminal in terms of
transmit power efficiency and reduced cost of the power amplifier. It
has been adopted as the uplink multiple access scheme in 3GPP Long Term
Evolution (LTE), or Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA).
