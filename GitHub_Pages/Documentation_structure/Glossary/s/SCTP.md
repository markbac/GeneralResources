# SCTP


Stream Control Transmission Protocol

The (SCTP) is a computer networking communications protocol which
operates at the transport layer and serves a role similar to the popular
protocols TCP and UDP. It is standardized by IETF in RFC 4960.

SCTP provides some of the features of both UDP and TCP: it is
message-oriented like UDP and ensures reliable, in-sequence transport of
messages with congestion control like TCP. It differs from those
protocols by providing multi-homing and redundant paths to increase
resilience and reliability.
