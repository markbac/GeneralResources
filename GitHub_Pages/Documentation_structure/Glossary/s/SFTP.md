Secure File Transfer Protocol

In computing, the SSH File Transfer Protocol (also Secure File Transfer
Protocol, or SFTP) is a network protocol that provides file access, file
transfer, and file management over any reliable data stream. It was
designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an extension
of the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) version 2.0 to provide secure file
transfer capabilities. The IETF Internet Draft states that, even though
this protocol is described in the context of the SSH-2 protocol, it
could be used in a number of different applications, such as secure file
transfer over Transport Layer Security (TLS) and transfer of management
information in VPN applications.

This protocol assumes that it is run over a secure channel, such as SSH,
that the server has already authenticated the client, and that the
identity of the client user is available to the protocol.
