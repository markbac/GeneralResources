Serving GPRS support node

The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) is the node that is serving the
MS/UE. The SGSN supports GPRS and/or UMTS. The SGSN keeps track of the
location of an individual MS/UE and performs security functions and
access control. The SGSN is connected to the GERAN base station system
through the Gb or Iu interface and/or to the UTRAN through the Iu
interface. A SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from
and to the mobile stations within its geographical service area. Its
tasks include packet routing and transfer, mobility management
(attach/detach and location management), logical link management, and
authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN
stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user
profiles (e.g., IMSI, address(es) used in the packet data network) of
all GPRS users registered with it.
