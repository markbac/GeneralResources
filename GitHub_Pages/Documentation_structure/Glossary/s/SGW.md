# SGW


signalling gateway

A signalling gateway (SGW) interfaces with the signalling plane of the
CS. It transforms lower layer protocols as Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (SCTP, an IP protocol) into Message Transfer Part (MTP, an
Signalling System 7 (SS7) protocol), to pass ISDN User Part (ISUP) from
the MGCF to the CS network.
