Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence
Leveraging Extensions

SIMPLE, the Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and
Presence Leveraging Extensions, is an instant messaging (IM) and
presence protocol suite based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force. Contrary to the vast
majority of IM and presence protocols used by software deployed today,
SIMPLE is an open standard like XMPP.
