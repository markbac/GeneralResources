# SLIP


Serial Line Interface Protocol

The Serial Line Internet Protocol (also SLIP) is an encapsulation of the
Internet Protocol designed to work over serial ports and modem
connections. It is documented in RFC 1055. On personal computers, SLIP
has been largely replaced by the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which is
better engineered, has more features and does not require its IP address
configuration to be set before it is established. On microcontrollers,
however, SLIP is still the preferred way of encapsulating IP packets due
to its very small overhead.
