Subject Matter Expert

A subject-matter expert (SME) or domain expert is a person who is an
authority in a particular area or topic. The term domain expert is
frequently used in expert systems software development, and there the
term always refers to the domain other than the software domain. A
domain expert is a person with special knowledge or skills in a
particular area of endeavour (e.g.Â an accountant is an expert in the
domain of accountancy). The development of accounting software requires
knowledge in two different domains: accounting and software. Some of the
development workers may be experts in one domain and not the other.
