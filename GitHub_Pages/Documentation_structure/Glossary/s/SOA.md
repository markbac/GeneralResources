Service-oriented architecture

Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where
services are provided to the other components by application components,
through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of
service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and
technologies. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be
accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as
retrieving a credit card statement online.

A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of
SOA:

1. It logically represents a business activity with a specified
    outcome.

2. It is self-contained.

3. It is a black box for its consumers.

4. It may consist of other underlying services.

    Different services can be used in conjunction to provide the
    functionality of a large software application, a principle SOA
    shares with modular programming. Service-oriented architecture
    integrates distributed, separately-maintained and -deployed software
    components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that
    facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network,
    especially over an IP network.
