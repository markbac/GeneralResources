# SOAP


Simple Object Access Protocol

SOAP (originally Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol
specification for exchanging structured information in the
implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to
induce extensibility, neutrality and independence. It uses XML
Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer
protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

SOAP allows processes running on disparate operating systems (such as
Windows and Linux) to communicate using Extensible Markup Language
(XML). Since Web protocols like HTTP are installed and running on all
operating systems, SOAP allows clients to invoke web services and
receive responses independent of language and platforms.\
