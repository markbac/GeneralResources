# SPEEX


Speex is an audio compression format specifically tuned for the
reproduction of human speech and also a free software speech codec that
may be used on VoIP applications and podcasts. It is based on the CELP
speech coding algorithm. Speex claims to be free of any patent
restrictions and is licensed under the revised (3-clause) BSD license.
It may be used with the Ogg container format or directly transmitted
over UDP/RTP. It may also be used with the FLV container format.

The Speex designers see their project as complementary to the Vorbis
general-purpose audio compression project.

Speex is a lossy format, i.e.Â quality is permanently degraded to reduce
file size.

The Speex project was created on February 13, 2002. The first
development versions of Speex were released under LGPL license, but as
of version 1.0 beta 1, Speex is released under Xiph's version of the
(revised) BSD license. Speex 1.0 was announced on March 24, 2003, after
a year of development. The last stable version of Speex encoder and
decoder is 1.2.0.

Xiph.Org now considers Speex obsolete; its successor is the more modern
Opus codec, which surpasses its performance in all areas.
