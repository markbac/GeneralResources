# SQL


SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and
designed for managing data held in a relational database management
system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream
management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling
structured data where there are relations between different
entities/variables of the data. SQL offers two main advantages over
older read/write APIs like ISAM or VSAM: first, it introduced the
concept of accessing many records with one single command; and second,
it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or
without an index.

Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus,
SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally
classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data
definition language (DDL), a data control language (DCL), and a data
manipulation language (DML). The scope of SQL includes data query, data
manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema
creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is
often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language
(4GL), it also includes procedural elements.
