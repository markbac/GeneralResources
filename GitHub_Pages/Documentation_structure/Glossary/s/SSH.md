# SSH


Secure Shell

Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating
network services securely over an unsecured network. The best known
example application is for remote login to computer systems by users.

SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a
client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an
SSH server. Common applications include remote command-line login and
remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with
SSH. The protocol specification distinguishes between two major
versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2.
