# STUN


Session Traversal Utilities for NAT

(STUN) is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol,
for traversal of network address translator (NAT) gateways in
applications of real-time voice, video, messaging, and other interactive
communications.

STUN is a tool used by other protocols, such as Interactive Connectivity
Establishment (ICE), the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), or WebRTC.
It provides a tool for hosts to discover the presence of a network
address translator, and to discover the mapped, usually public, Internet
Protocol (IP) address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the
application's User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. The
protocol requires assistance from a third-party network server (STUN
server) located on the opposing (public) side of the NAT, usually the
public Internet.

Originally, STUN was an acronym for Simple Traversal of User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) through Network Address Translators, but this title was
changed in a specification of an updated set of methods published as RFC
5389, retaining the same acronym
