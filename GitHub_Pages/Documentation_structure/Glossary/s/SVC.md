# SVC


Soft Virtual Service

Switched virtual circuits (SVCs) are generally set up on a per-call
basis and are disconnected when the call is terminated; however, a
permanent virtual circuit (PVC) can be established as an option to
provide a dedicated circuit link between two facilities. PVC
configuration is usually preconfigured by the service provider. Unlike
SVCs, PVC are usually very seldom broken/disconnected.

A switched virtual circuit (SVC) is a virtual circuit that is
dynamically established on demand and is torn down when transmission is
complete, for example after a phone call or a file download. SVCs are
used in situations where data transmission is sporadic and/or not always
between the same data terminal equipment (DTE) endpoints.
