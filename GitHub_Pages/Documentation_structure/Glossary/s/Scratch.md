# Scratch


Scratch is a visual programming language and online community targeted
primarily at children. Using Scratch, users can create online projects
and develop them into almost anything by using a simple block-like
interface. When they are ready, they then share, and also discuss their
creations with each other. Developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group
at the MIT Media Lab, the service is designed to help children (ages 8
and up) learn to utilize their imaginations, practice common sense, and,
most importantly, to interact with computers.
