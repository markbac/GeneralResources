# Simplex


Simplex communication is a communication channel that sends information
in one direction only.

The International Telecommunication Union definition is a communications
channel that operates in one direction at a time, but that may be
reversible; this is termed half duplex in other contexts. A duplex
communication channel requires two simplex channels operating in
opposite directions.
