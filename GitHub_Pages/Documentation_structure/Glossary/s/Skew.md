# Skew


Clock skew (sometimes called timing skew) is a phenomenon in synchronous
digital circuit systems (such as computer systems) in which the same
sourced clock signal arrives at different components at different times
i.e.Â the instantaneous difference between the readings of any two clocks
is called their skew.
