# T-Shirt Sizing


T-shirt sizing is a way to practice relative sizing. By comparing
stories, you can break them into buckets of extra-small, small, medium,
large, and extra-large.

Estimating in relative buckets is more important than estimating
absolute time or effort. We want to understand how things compare to
each other in a rough sense, and not waste time on false precision.
