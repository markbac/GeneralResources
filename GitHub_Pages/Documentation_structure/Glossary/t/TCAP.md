# TCAP


Transaction Capabilities Application Part

Transaction Capabilities Application Part, from ITU-T recommendations
Q.771-Q.775 or ANSI T1.114 is a protocol for Signalling System 7
networks. Its primary purpose is to facilitate multiple concurrent
dialogs between the same sub-systems on the same machines, using
Transaction IDs to differentiate these, similar to the way TCP ports
facilitate multiplexing connections between the same IP addresses on the
Internet.

TCAP uses ASN.1 BER encoding, as well as the protocols it encapsulates,
namely MAP in mobile phone networks or INAP in Intelligent Networks.
