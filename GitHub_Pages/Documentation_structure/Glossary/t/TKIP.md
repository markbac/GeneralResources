# TKIP


Temporal Key Integrity Protocol

Temporal Key Integrity Protocol or TKIP /tiːˈkɪp/ is a security protocol
used in the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard. TKIP was designed
by the IEEE 802.11i task group and the Wi-Fi Alliance as an interim
solution to replace WEP without requiring the replacement of legacy
hardware. This was necessary because the breaking of WEP had left Wi-Fi
networks without viable link-layer security, and a solution was required
for already deployed hardware. However, TKIP itself is no longer
considered secure, and was deprecated in the 2012 revision of the 802.11
standard.
