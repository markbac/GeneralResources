# TOML


TOML is a file format for configuration files. It is intended to be easy
to read and write due to obvious semantics which aim to be "minimal", and
is designed to map unambiguously to a dictionary. Its specification is
open-source, and receives community contributions. TOML is used in a number
of software projects, and is implemented in many programming languages.
The name "TOML" is an acronym for "Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language"
referring to its creator, Tom Preston-Werner.
