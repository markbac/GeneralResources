# TTY


A terminal emulator, terminal application, or term, is a program that
emulates a video terminal within some other display architecture. Though
typically synonymous with a shell or text terminal, the term terminal
covers all remote terminals, including graphical interfaces. A terminal
emulator inside a graphical user interface is often called a terminal
window.

A terminal window allows the user access to a text terminal and all its
applications such as command-line interfaces (CLI) and text user
interface (TUI) applications. These may be running either on the same
machine or on a different one via telnet, ssh, or dial-up. On Unix-like
operating systems, it is common to have one or more terminal windows
connected to the local machine.
