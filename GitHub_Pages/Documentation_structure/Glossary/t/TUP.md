# TUP


Telephone User Part

Telephone User Part (TUP) provides conventional PSTN telephony services
across the Signalling System No.Â 7 (SS7) network. TUP was the first
layer 4 protocol defined by the standards bodies and as such did not
provision for ISDN services. It has now largely been replaced by ISUP.
However, it can still be found in operational use in some parts of the
world (e.g., China).

TUP is defined in ITU-T Recommendations Q.721-725. These define the
international telephone call control signalling functions for use over
SS7.

Various national variants of TUP have evolved, some of which provide
varying degrees of support for ISDN.
