# Tcl/tk


Tk is a free and open-source, cross-platform widget toolkit that
provides a library of basic elements of GUI widgets for building a
graphical user interface (GUI) in many programming languages.

Tk provides a number of widgets commonly needed to develop desktop
applications, such as button, menu, canvas, text, frame, label, etc. Tk
has been ported to run on most flavors of Linux, Mac OS, Unix, and
Microsoft Windows. Like Tcl, Tk supports Unicode within the Basic
Multilingual Plane but it has not yet been extended to handle 32-bit
Unicode.

Tk was designed to be extended, and a wide range of extensions are
available that offer new widgets or other capabilities.

Since Tcl/Tk 8, it offers "native look and feel" (for instance, menus
and buttons are displayed in the manner of "native" software for any
given platform). Highlights of version 8.5 include a new theming engine,
originally called Tk Tile, but now generally referred to as "themed Tk",
as well as improved font rendering.
