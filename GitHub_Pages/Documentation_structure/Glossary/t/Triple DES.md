# Triple DES


In cryptography, Triple DES (3DES), officially the Triple Data
Encryption Algorithm (TDEA or Triple DEA), is a symmetric-key block
cipher, which applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data
block.

While the government and industry standards abbreviate the algorithm's
name as TDES (Triple DES) and TDEA (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm),
RFC 1851 called it 3DES from the time it first promulgated the idea, and
this namesake has since come into wide use by most vendors, users, and
cryptographers.
