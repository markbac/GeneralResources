# Twisted pair


Twisted pair cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors of a
single circuit are twisted together for the purposes of improving
electromagnetic compatibility. Compared to a single conductor or an
untwisted balanced pair, a twisted pair reduces electromagnetic
radiation, crosstalk between neighboring pairs and improves rejection of
external electromagnetic interference
