# URL


Universal (or Uniform) Resource Locator

Contains information about how to fetch a resource from its location.
For example:

- <http://example.com/mypage.html>

- <ftp://example.com/download.zip>

- [mailto:user\@example.com](mailto:user@example.com){.uri}

- {+}file:///home/user/file.txt+ (file:////home//user//file.txt)

- <http://example.com/resource?foo=bar#fragment>

- /other/link.html (A relative URL, only useful in the context of
    another URL)

    URLs always start with a protocol (http) and usually contain
    information such as the network host name (example.com) and often a
    document path (/foo/mypage.html). URLs may have query parameters and
    fragment identifiers.
