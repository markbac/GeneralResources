# URN


Uniform Resource

Identifies a resource by name. It always starts with the prefix urn: For
example:

- urn:isbn:0451450523 to identify a book by its ISBN number.

- urn:uuid:6e8bc430-9c3a-11d9-9669-0800200c9a66 a globally unique
    identifier

- urn:publishing:book - An XML namespace that identifies the document
    as a type of book.\
    URNs can identify ideas and concepts. They are not restricted to
    identifying documents. When a URN does represent a document, it can
    be translated into a URL by a "resolver". The document can then be
    downloaded from the URL.
