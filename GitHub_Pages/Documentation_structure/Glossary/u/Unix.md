# Unix


Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems
that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the
1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie,
and others.

Initially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&T licensed Unix to
outside parties in the late 1970s, leading to a variety of both academic
and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of
California, Berkeley (BSD), Microsoft (Xenix), IBM (AIX), and Sun
Microsystems (Solaris). In the early 1990s, AT&T sold its rights in Unix
to Novell, which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation
(SCO) in 1995. The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group, a neutral
industry consortium, which allows the use of the mark for certified
operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).
As of 2014, the Unix version with the largest installed base is Apple's
macOS.
