# User Plane


In routing, the forwarding plane, sometimes called the data plane or
user plane, defines the part of the router architecture that decides
what to do with packets arriving on an inbound interface. Most commonly,
it refers to a table in which the router looks up the destination
address of the incoming packet and retrieves the information necessary
to determine the path from the receiving element, through the internal
forwarding fabric of the router, and to the proper outgoing
interface(s). The IP Multimedia Subsystem architecture uses the term
transport plane to describe a function roughly equivalent to the routing
control plane.\
