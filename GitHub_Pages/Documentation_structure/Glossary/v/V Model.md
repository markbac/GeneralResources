# V Model


In software development, the V-model represents a development process
that may be considered an extension of the waterfall model, and is an
example of the more general V-model. Instead of moving down in a linear
way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, to form
the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between
each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of
testing. The horizontal and vertical axes represents time or project
completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain
abstraction uppermost), respectively.\
