# V.92


V.92 is an ITU-T recommendation, titled Enhancements to Recommendation
V.90, that establishes a modem standard allowing near 56 kb/s download
and 48 kb/s upload rates. With V.92 PCM is used for both the upstream
and downstream connections; previously 56K modems only used PCM for
downstream data.
