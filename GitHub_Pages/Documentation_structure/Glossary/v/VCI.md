# VCI


Virtual Channel Identifier

The VCI, used in conjunction with the VPI (virtual path indicator),
indicates where an ATM cell is to travel over a network. ATM, or
asynchronous transfer mode, is a method that many ISPs (Internet Service
Providers) use to transfer data to client computers. Because ATM sends
packets over fixed channels, the data is easier to track than
information sent over the standard TCP/IP protocol.

The VCI within each ATM cell defines the fixed channel on which the
packet of information should be sent. It is a 16-bit field, compared to
the VPI, which is only 8 bits. Since this numerical tag specifies the
virtual channel that each packet belongs to, it prevents interference
with other data being sent across the network.
