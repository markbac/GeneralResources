# VLAN


Virtual LAN

A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and
isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer
2).\[1\]\[2\] LAN is the abbreviation for local area network and in this
context virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by
additional logic. VLANs work by applying tags to network packets and
handling these tags in networking systems -- creating the appearance and
functionality of network traffic that is physically on a single network
but acts as if it is split between separate networks. In this way, VLANs
can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the
same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling
and networking devices to be deployed.
