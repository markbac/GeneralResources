Virtual Private Network

A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a
public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared
or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected
to the private network. Applications running across a VPN may therefore
benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private
network.
