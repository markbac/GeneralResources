Virtual (VPN) Routing and Forwarding

In IP-based computer networks, (VRF) is a technology that allows
multiple instances of a routing table to co-exist within the same router
at the same time. Because the routing instances are independent, the
same or overlapping IP addresses can be used without conflicting with
each other. Network functionality is improved because network paths can
be segmented without requiring multiple routers.
