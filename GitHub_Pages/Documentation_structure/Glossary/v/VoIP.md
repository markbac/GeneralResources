Voice over IP

Voice over Internet Protocol (also voice over IP, VoIP or IP telephony)
is a methodology and group of technologies for the delivery of voice
communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP)
networks, such as the Internet. The terms Internet telephony, broadband
telephony, and broadband phone service specifically refer to the
provisioning of communications services (voice, fax, SMS,
voice-messaging) over the public Internet, rather than via the public
switched telephone network (PSTN).

Voice over IP has been implemented in various ways using both
proprietary protocols and protocols based on open standards. These
protocols can be used by a VoIP phone, special-purpose software, a
mobile application or integrated into a web page. VoIP protocols
include:

- Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), connection management protocol
    developed by the IETF

- H.323, one of the first VoIP call signaling and control protocols
    that found widespread implementation. Since the development of
    newer, less complex protocols such as MGCP and SIP, H.323
    deployments are increasingly limited to carrying existing long-haul
    network traffic.\[citation needed\]

- Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP), connection management for
    media gateways

- H.248, control protocol for media gateways across a converged
    internetwork consisting of the traditional public switched telephone
    network (PSTN) and modern packet networks

- Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), transport protocol for real-time
    audio and video data

- Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP), sister protocol for RTP
    providing stream statistics and status information

- Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP), encrypted version of RTP

- Session Description Protocol (SDP), file format used principally by
    SIP to describe VoIP connections

- Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX), protocol used between VoIP servers

- Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), instant
    messaging, presence information, and contact list maintenance

- Jingle, adds peer-to-peer session control to XMPP

- Skype protocol, proprietary Internet telephony protocol suite based
    on peer-to-peer architecture
