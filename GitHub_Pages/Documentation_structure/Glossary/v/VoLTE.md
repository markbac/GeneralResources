Voice over Long-Term Evolution

Voice over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE) is a standard for high-speed
wireless communication for mobile phones and data terminals - including
IoT devices and wearables. It is based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem
(IMS) network, with specific profiles for control and media planes of
voice service on LTE defined by GSMA in PRD IR.92. This approach results
in the voice service (control and media planes) being delivered as data
flows within the LTE data bearer. This means that there is no dependency
on (or ultimately, requirement for) the legacy circuit-switched voice
network to be maintained. VoLTE has up to three times more voice and
data capacity than 3G UMTS and up to six times more than 2G GSM.
Furthermore, it frees up bandwidth because VoLTE's packets headers are
smaller than those of unoptimized VoIP/LTE.
