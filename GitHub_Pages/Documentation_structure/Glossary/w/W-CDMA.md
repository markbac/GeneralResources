# W-CDMA


Wideband Code-division multiple access

W-CDMA or WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access), along with
UMTS-FDD, UTRA-FDD, or IMT-2000 CDMA Direct Spread is an air interface
standard found in 3G mobile telecommunications networks. It supports
conventional cellular voice, text and MMS services, but can also carry
data at high speeds, allowing mobile operators to deliver higher
bandwidth applications including streaming and broadband Internet
access.

W-CDMA uses the DS-CDMA channel access method with a pair of 5 MHz wide
channels. In contrast, the competing CDMA2000 system uses one or more
available 1.25 MHz channels for each direction of communication. W-CDMA
systems are widely criticized for their large spectrum usage, which
delayed deployment in countries that acted relatively slowly in
allocating new frequencies specifically for 3G services (such as the
United States).
