# WBC


Wholesale Broadband Managed

The vanilla WBC product is the most flexible of the three. Crudely
speaking, it is not that dissimilar to DataStream. But rather than
having to rent capacity at every exchange from BT, the ISP has to
install equipment ("have presence") at BT's WBC Aggregation Points
(APs). There are twenty of these dotted around the country, and these
are the same as the Core nodes discussed on the 21CN overview. One
aggregation point will cover a region of the country, so an ISP would
need to have presence at all twenty to cover the entire of the UK.\
