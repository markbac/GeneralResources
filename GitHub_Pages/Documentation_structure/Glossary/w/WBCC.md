Wholesale Broadband Connect Converge

There is relatively little public information available about this
product. It is known to roll the voice and broadband products in to a
package, with BT providing the ISP a single bill for both. Given that
this product will again be based on WBC, one can only assume that the
same product options and QoS would also be available.
