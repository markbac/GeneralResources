# WEP


Wired Equivalent Privacy

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security algorithm for IEEE 802.11
wireless networks. Introduced as part of the original 802.11 standard
ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide data confidentiality
comparable to that of a traditional wired network. WEP, recognizable by
its key of 10 or 26 hexadecimal digits (40 or 104 bits), was at one time
widely in use and was often the first security choice presented to users
by router configuration tools.

In 2003 the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP had been superseded by
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). In 2004, with the ratification of the full
802.11i standard (i.e.Â WPA2), the IEEE declared that both WEP-40 and
WEP-104 have been deprecated.

WEP was the only encryption protocol available to 802.11a and 802.11b
devices built before the WPA standard, which was available for 802.11g
devices.
