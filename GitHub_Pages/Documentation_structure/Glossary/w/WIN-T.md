# WIN-T


Warfighter Information Network - Tactical

WIN-T is the U.S. Army's tactical network backbone, providing secure
voice and data communications for soldiers on the battlefield without
the need for fixed infrastructure. By connecting soldiers with their
commanders, WIN-T is changing the way the U.S. Army fights by providing
life-saving information on-the-move, anywhere in the world. WIN-T
enables soldiers to:

- Stream real-time video over the network

- View a topographical map of friendly forces

- Send texts requesting medical assistance

- Digitally call for artillery support

- Access mission command apps like CPOF and TIGR

    WIN-T INCREMENT 1: COMMUNICATIONS AT-THE-HALT\
    Originally known as the Joint Network Node Network (JNN-N) program,
    WIN-T Increment 1 (Inc. 1) began fielding in 2004 to support combat
    missions during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi
    Freedom.

    With WIN-T Inc. 1, for the first time in history, the soldiers on
    the battlefield had a high-speed, interoperable voice and data
    communications network at the battalion level.

    WIN-T INCREMENT 2: COMMUNICATIONS ON-THE-MOVE\
    The Army's 10th Mountain Division was the first to field WIN-T
    Inc. 2 new capabilities when they deployed for Afghanistan in
    July 2013. WIN-T Inc. 2's unique value was immediately recognized,
    as it provided soldiers with communications even as fixed
    infrastructure was removed.

    The Tactical Communication Nodes in Inc. 2 took the first step in
    providing a mobile infrastructure on the battlefield. This includes
    mobile Point Of Presence systems (installed on select vehicles at
    battalion levels and above, which include four companies of up to
    200 soldiers and about 10 to 30 vehicles each), vehicle wireless
    packages, and the Soldier Network Extension (for Company-level
    connectivity).

    Increment 2 enables mission command from brigade to division to
    company through a completely ad-hoc, self-forming network.
    Commanders and select staff now have the ability to maneuver
    anywhere on the battlefield and maintain connectivity to the
    network, without the need to stop and set up communications, making
    them vulnerable to attack.
