Windows Media Audio

Windows Media Audio (WMA) is the name of a series of audio codecs and
their corresponding audio coding formats developed by Microsoft. It is a
proprietary technology that forms part of the Windows Media framework.
WMA consists of four distinct codecs. The original WMA codec, known
simply as WMA, was conceived as a competitor to the popular MP3 and
RealAudio codecs. WMA Pro, a newer and more advanced codec, supports
multichannel and high resolution audio. A lossless codec, WMA Lossless,
compresses audio data without loss of audio fidelity (the regular WMA
format is lossy).\[3\] WMA Voice, targeted at voice content, applies
compression using a range of low bit rates.
