Wi-Fi Protected Setup

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS; originally, Wi-Fi Simple Config) is a
network security standard to create a secure wireless home network.

Created by the Wi-Fi Alliance and introduced in 2006, the goal of the
protocol is to allow home users who know little of wireless security and
may be intimidated by the available security options to set up Wi-Fi
Protected Access, as well as making it easy to add new devices to an
existing network without entering long passphrases. Prior to the
standard, several competing solutions were developed by different
vendors to address the same need.
