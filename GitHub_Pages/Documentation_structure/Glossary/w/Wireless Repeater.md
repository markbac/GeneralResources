# Wireless Repeater


A wireless repeater (also called wireless range extender) takes an
existing signal from a wireless router or wireless access point and
rebroadcasts it to create a second network. When two or more hosts have
to be connected with one another over the IEEE 802.11 protocol and the
distance is too long for a direct connection to be established, a
wireless repeater is used to bridge the gap. It can be a specialized
stand alone computer networking device. Also, some Wireless network
interface controllers (WNIC)s optionally support operating in such a
mode. Those outside of the primary network will be able to connect
through the new "repeated" network. However, as far as the original
router or access point is concerned, only the repeater MAC is connected,
making it necessary to enable safety features on the wireless repeater.
Wireless repeaters are commonly used to improve signal range and
strength within homes and small offices.
