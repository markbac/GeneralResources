# XML Schema


An XML schema is a description of a type of XML document, typically
expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of
documents of that type, above and beyond the basic syntactical
constraints imposed by XML itself. These constraints are generally
expressed using some combination of grammatical rules governing the
order of elements, Boolean predicates that the content must satisfy,
data types governing the content of elements and attributes, and more
specialized rules such as uniqueness and referential integrity
constraints.

There are languages developed specifically to express XML schemas. The
Document Type Definition (DTD) language, which is native to the XML
specification, is a schema language that is of relatively limited
capability, but that also has other uses in XML aside from the
expression of schemas. Two more expressive XML schema languages in
widespread use are XML Schema (with a capital S) and RELAX NG.

The mechanism for associating an XML document with a schema varies
according to the schema language. The association may be achieved via
markup within the XML document itself, or via some external means.
