# XSS


Cross Site Scripting

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability
typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject
client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site
scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access
controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried
out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security
vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007. Bug bounty company
HackerOne in 2017 reported that XSS is still a major threat vector. XSS
effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk,
depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site
and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's
owner.
