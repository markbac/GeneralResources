# YAML


YAML Ain't Markup Language

YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly
used for configuration files and in applications where data is being
stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications
applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal
syntax which intentionally differs from SGML. It uses both Python-style
indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses
\[...\] for lists and {...} for maps thus JSON files are valid YAML 1.2.

Custom data types are allowed, but YAML natively encodes scalars (such
as strings, integers, and floats), lists, and associative arrays (also
known as maps, dictionaries or hashes). These data types are based on
the Perl programming language, though all commonly used high-level
programming languages share very similar concepts. The colon-centered
syntax, used for expressing key-value pairs, is inspired by electronic
mail headers as defined in RFC 822, and the document separator --- is
borrowed from MIME (RFC 2046). Escape sequences are reused from C, and
whitespace wrapping for multi-line strings is inspired by HTML. Lists
and hashes can contain nested lists and hashes, forming a tree
structure; arbitrary graphs can be represented using YAML aliases
(similar to XML in SOAP). YAML is intended to be read and written in
streams, a feature inspired by SAX.

The official recommended filename extension for YAML files is .yaml
