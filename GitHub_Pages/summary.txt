Given, for example, a directory structure like 

Documentation_structure
├── cat
│   ├── monkey.md
│   ├── whatabout.md
│   └── how-to.md
└── dog
    ├── faq.md
    └── sheep
        └── faq.md

I want to generate a markdown file called SUMMARY.md like 

# cat

- [Command Line Tool](cat/dog.md)
- [Command ](cat/whatabout.md)
- [How To](cat/how-to.md)

# dog

- [Command Line Tool](dog/faq.md)
    - [init](dog/sheep/faq.md)

Note that each new level of subdirs will increase level of indentation in the markdown file created. i.e sheep is a sub dire of dog so therefore links to file sin that directory an indented more than those in dof

For any empty directories create a link to a file called the directory name within that directory, 
e.g with 
Documentation_structure
├── cat
   └── horse

if horse is empty create - [horse(cat/horse/horse.dog.md)

All none markdown (.md) files shall be ignored

the text in the [] will be from teh first line of teh file it reference, 

e.g 
the first line of cat/dog.md is 
# Command Line Tool
and will give you [Command Line Tool] for the link description (strip all leading # and space characters)

the first line of cat/whatabout.md is 
# Command
and will give you [Command] for the link description 

the first line of cat/how-to.md is 
# How To
and will give you [How To] for the link description 

there can be an indefinite level of sub dirs

can you create a script in python for this. Do not use the markdown library
