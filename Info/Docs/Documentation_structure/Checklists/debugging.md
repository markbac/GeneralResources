# Debugging

## General approach to debugging

- DBG-1      Have you set a maximum time for quick and dirty debugging?
- DBG-2      Do you research an issue to ensure an easy answer is not readily available?
- DBG-3      Do you use all available debugging tools? (e.g., warning messages, execution tracing and profiling, scaffolding, interactive debugging, etc.)
- DBG-4      Do you assume that errors are your fault?
- DBG-5      Do you avoid the trial-and-error, superstitious approach to debugging?
- DBG-6      Do you use several different techniques to find errors and alternate approaches?
- DBG-7      Do you get help when appropriate?
- DBG-8      If an issue appears that it will take longer to identify or fix than initially thought, do you notify project management as appropriate?
- DBG-9      Do you move on when appropriate?  
- DBG-10    Do you verify that the fix is correct?
- DBG-11    Do you use debugging as an opportunity to learn?

## Techniques for Finding Errors. Have you tried to

- DBG-12    ... Use all the data available to form a hypothesis?
- DBG-13    ... Refine the test cases that produce the error?
- DBG-14    ... Reproduce the error several different ways?
- DBG-15    ... Generate more data to generate more hypotheses?
- DBG-16    ... Use results of negative tests?
- DBG-17    ... Brainstorm for possible hypotheses?
- DBG-18    ... Narrow the suspicious region of the code?
- DBG-19    ... Check code that's changed recently?
- DBG-20    ... Expand the suspicious region of the code?
- DBG-21    ... Integrate incrementally?
- DBG-22    ... Be suspicious of routines that have had errors before?
- DBG-23    ... Use brute force?
- DBG-24    ... Check for common errors?
- DBG-25    ... Use confessional debugging?
- DBG-26    ... Take a break from the problem?

## Techniques for Fixing Errors. Have you tried to

- DBG-27    ... Understand the problem?
- DBG-28    ... Check your work?
- DBG-29    â€¦Verify that the fix is correct?
- DBG-30    ... Relax?
- DBG-31    ... Confirm the error diagnosis?
- DBG-32    ... Save the original source code?
- DBG-33    ... Fix the problem, not the symptom?
- DBG-34    ... Change the code only for good reason?
- DBG-35    ... Understand the program as well as the problem?
- DBG-36    ... Make one change at a time?
- DBG-37    ... Look for similar errors?
- DBG-38    ... Have a break?
