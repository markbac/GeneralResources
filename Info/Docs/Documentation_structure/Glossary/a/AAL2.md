# AAL2


ATM Adaptation Layer 2

ATM Adaptation Layer 2 (AAL2) is an ATM adaptation layer for
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), used primarily in telecommunications;
for example, it is used for the Iu interfaces in the Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System, and is also used for transporting digital
voice. The standard specifications related to AAL2 are ITU standards
I.363.2 and I366.1.

What is AAL2?\
AAL2 is a variable bitrate, connection-oriented, low latency service
originally intended to adapt voice for transmission over ATM. Like other
ATM adaptation layers, AAL2 defines segmentation and reassembly of
higher-layer packets into ATM cells, in this case packets of data
containing voice and control information. AAL2 is further separated into
two sub-layers that help with the mapping from upper layer services to
ATM cells. These are named Service Specific Convergence Sub-layer (SSCS)
and Common Part Sub-layer (CPS).
