# ALCAP


Access Link Control Application Protocol

Control plane protocol for the transport layer in 3rd Generation UMTS
networks is called ALCAP ("Access Link Control Application Part"). ALCAP
is defined by 3GPP as equivalent of ITU recommendation Q.2630.2. Basic
functionality of ALCAP is multiplexing of different users onto one AAL2
transmission path using channel IDs (CIDs). It is used in the UMTS
access network UTRAN along with ATM, while IPBCP is use for IP links in
the core of the network.

ALCAP makes it possible for up to 248 channels to be multiplexed onto
one AAL2 bearer.
