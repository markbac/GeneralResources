# Automated Build


In the context of software development, build refers to the process that
converts files and other assets under the developers' responsibility
into a software product in its final or consumable form. The build is
automated when these steps are repeatable, require no direct human
intervention, and can be performed at any time with no information other
than what is stored in the source code control repository.
