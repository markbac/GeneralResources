# Awk


AWK is a programming language designed for text processing and typically
used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is a standard feature
of most Unix-like operating systems.

The AWK language is a data-driven scripting language consisting of a set
of actions to be taken against streams of textual data -- either run
directly on files or used as part of a pipeline -- for purposes of
extracting or transforming text, such as producing formatted reports.
The language extensively uses the string datatype, associative arrays
(that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and regular expressions. While
AWK has a limited intended application domain and was especially
designed to support one-liner programs, the language is Turing-complete,
and even the early Bell Labs users of AWK often wrote well-structured
large AWK programs.
