# B2B


business-to-business

Business-to-business (B2B or, in some countries, BtoB) refers to a
situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with
another. This typically occurs when:

A business is sourcing materials for their production process (e.g. a
food manufacturer purchasing salt).\
A business needs the services of another for operational reasons (e.g. a
food manufacturer employing an accountancy firm to audit their
finances).\
A business re-sells goods and services produced by others (e.g. a
retailer buying the end product from the food manufacturer).\
B2B is often contrasted with business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B
commerce, it is often the case that the parties to the relationship have
comparable negotiating power, and even when they do not, each party
typically involves professional staff and legal counsel in the
negotiation of terms, whereas B2C is shaped to a far greater degree by
economic implications of information asymmetry. However, within a B2B
context, large companies may have many commercial, resource and
information advantages over smaller businesses.
