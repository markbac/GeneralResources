# CAP


CAMEL Application Part

The CAMEL Application Part (CAP) is a signalling protocol used in the
Intelligent Network (IN) architecture. CAP is a Remote Operations
Service Element (ROSE) user protocol, and as such is layered on top of
the Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) of the SS\#7
protocol suite. CAP is based on a subset of the ETSI Core and allows for
the implementation of carrier-grade, value added services such as
unified messaging, prepaid, fraud control and Freephone in both the GSM
voice and GPRS data networks. CAMEL is a means of adding intelligent
applications to mobile (rather than fixed) networks. It builds upon
established practices in the fixed line telephony business that are
generally classed under the heading of (Intelligent Network Application
Part) or INAP CS-2 protocol
