# COFDM


Coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing

In coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (COFDM), forward
error correction (convolutional coding) and time/frequency interleaving
are applied to the signal being transmitted. This is done to overcome
errors in mobile communication channels affected by multipath
propagation and Doppler effects.
