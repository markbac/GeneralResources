# Cat 5


Category 5 cable, commonly referred to as Cat 5, is a twisted pair cable
for computer networks. The cable standard provides performance of up to
100 MHz and is suitable for most varieties of Ethernet over twisted
pair. Cat 5 is also used to carry other signals such as telephony and
video.

This cable is commonly connected using punch-down blocks and modular
connectors. Most Category 5 cables are unshielded, relying on the
balanced line twisted pair design and differential signaling for noise
rejection.

The category 5 specification was deprecated in 2001 and is superseded by
the category 5e specification.
