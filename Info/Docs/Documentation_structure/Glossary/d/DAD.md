# DAD


Disciplined agile delivery (DAD) is a process decision framework that
enables simplified process decisions around incremental and iterative
solution delivery. DAD builds on the many practices espoused by
advocates of agile software development, including Scrum, agile
modeling, lean software development, and others.

The primary reference for disciplined agile delivery is the book of same
name, written by Scott Ambler and Mark Lines.

In particular, DAD has been identified as a means of moving beyond
Scrum. According to Cutter Senior Consultant Bhuvan Unhelkar, "The DAD
framework provides a carefully constructed mechanism that not only
streamlines IT work, but more importantly, enables scaling." Paul Gorans
and Philippe Kruchten call for more discipline in implementation of
agile approaches and indicate that DAD, as an example framework, is \"a
hybrid agile approach to enterprise IT solution delivery that provides a
solid foundation from which to scale.
