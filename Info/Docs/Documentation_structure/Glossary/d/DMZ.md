# DMZ


Demilitarized Zone

In computer security, a DMZ or demilitarized zone (sometimes referred to
as a perimeter network) is a physical or logical subnetwork that
contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to an
untrusted network, usually a larger network such as the Internet. The
purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an
organization's local area network (LAN): an external network node can
access only what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the
organization's network is firewalled. The DMZ functions as a small,
isolated network positioned between the Internet and the private network
and, if its design is effective, allows the organization extra time to
detect and address breaches before they would further penetrate into the
internal networks.\
