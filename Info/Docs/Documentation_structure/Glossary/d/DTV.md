Digital TV

Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of television signals,
including the sound channel, using digital encoding, in contrast to the
earlier television technology, analog television, in which the video and
audio are carried by analog signals. It is an innovative advance that
represents the first significant evolution in television technology
since color television in the 1950s. Digital TV makes more economical
use of scarce radio spectrum space; it can transmit multiple channels in
the same bandwidth occupied by a single channel of analog television,
and provides many new features that analog television cannot. A
switchover from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2006 in some
countries, and many industrial countries have now completed the
changeover, while other countries are in various stages of adaptation.
Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in
different parts of the world
