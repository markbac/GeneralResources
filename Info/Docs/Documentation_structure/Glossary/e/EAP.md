# EAP


Extensible Authentication Protocol

Extensible Authentication Protocol, or EAP, is an authentication
framework frequently used in wireless networks and point-to-point
connections. It is defined in RFC 3748, which made RFC 2284 obsolete,
and is updated by RFC 5247.

EAP is an authentication framework for providing the transport and usage
of keying material and parameters generated by EAP methods. There are
many methods defined by RFCs and a number of vendor specific methods and
new proposals exist. EAP is not a wire protocol; instead it only defines
message formats. Each protocol that uses EAP defines a way to
encapsulate EAP messages within that protocol's messages.

EAP is in wide use. For example, in IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) the WPA and WPA2
standards have adopted IEEE 802.1X with one hundred EAP Types as the
official authentication mechanisms\
