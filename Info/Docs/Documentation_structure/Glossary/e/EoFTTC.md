Ethernet over Fibre to the Cabinet

Ethernet over Fibre to the Cabinet (EoFTTC) is provided by copper from
your business premises over the short distance to the green cabinets in
the street. Unlike standard broadband where the copper then continues
all the way to the exchange, Ethernet over Fibre to the Cabinet traffic
travels across a shared fibre optic circuit to the exchange. The extra
distance doesn't lead to ongoing degradation of performance, which
allows access to up to 20Mbps symmetrical speed with the additional
boost downstream making a total of 76Mbps downstream bandwidth.\
