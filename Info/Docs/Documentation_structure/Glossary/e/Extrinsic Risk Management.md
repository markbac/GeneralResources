# Extrinsic Risk Management


Formal *risk management* techniques that are added to a project or
processes to explicitly mange risks. An example would be using a top 10
risks list to explicitly identify, prioritize, plan mitigation, and
report outcome of risk management. Compare to *intrinsic risk
management*.\
CxOne uses *corrective activity management* techniques to handles some
details of *extrinsic risk management*.
