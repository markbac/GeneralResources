# FemtoCell


In telecommunications, a femtocell is a small, low-power cellular base
station, typically designed for use in a home or small business. A
broader term which is more widespread in the industry is small cell,
with femtocell as a subset. It is also called femto AccessPoint (AP). It
connects to the service provider's network via broadband (such as DSL or
cable); current designs typically support four to eight simultaneously
active mobile phones in a residential setting depending on version
number and femtocell hardware, and eight to sixteen mobile phones in
enterprise settings. A femtocell allows service providers to extend
service coverage indoors or at the cell edge, especially where access
would otherwise be limited or unavailable. Although much attention is
focused on WCDMA, the concept is applicable to all standards, including
GSM, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA, WiMAX and LTE solutions.\
