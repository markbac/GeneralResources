# Gigabit Ethernet


In computer networking, Gigabit Ethernet (GbE or 1 GigE) is the various
technologies for transmitting Ethernet frames at a rate of a gigabit per
second (1,000,000,000 bits per second), as defined by the IEEE
802.3-2008 standard. It came into use beginning in 1999, gradually
supplanting Fast Ethernet in wired local networks, as a result of being
considerably faster. The cables and equipment are very similar to
previous standards and have been very common and economical since 2010.
