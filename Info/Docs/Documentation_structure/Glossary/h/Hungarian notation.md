# Hungarian notation


Hungarian notation is an identifier naming convention in computer
programming, in which the name of a variable or function indicates its
intention or kind, and in some dialects its type. The original Hungarian
Notation uses intention or kind in its naming convention and is
sometimes called Apps Hungarian as it became popular in the Microsoft
Apps division in the development of Word, Excel and other apps. As the
Microsoft Windows division adopted the naming convention, they used the
actual data type for naming, and this convention became widely spread
through the Windows API; this is sometimes called Systems Hungarian
notation.
