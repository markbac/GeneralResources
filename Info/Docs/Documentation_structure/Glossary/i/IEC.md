International Electrotechnical Commission

The International Electrotechnical Commission is an international
standards organization that prepares and publishes International
Standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies --
collectively known as "electrotechnology". IEC standards cover a vast
range of technologies from power generation, transmission and
distribution to home appliances and office equipment, semiconductors,
fibre optics, batteries, solar energy, nanotechnology and marine energy
as well as many others. The IEC also manages three global conformity
assessment systems that certify whether equipment, system or components
conform to its International Standards.

The IEC charter embraces all electrotechnologies including energy
production and distribution, electronics, magnetics and
electromagnetics, electroacoustics, multimedia, telecommunication and
medical technology, as well as associated general disciplines such as
terminology and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility (by its Advisory
Committee on Electromagnetic Compatibility, ACEC), measurement and
performance, dependability, design and development, safety and the
environment.
