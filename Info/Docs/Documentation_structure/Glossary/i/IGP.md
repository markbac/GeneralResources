# IGP


Interior Gateway Protocol

An interior gateway protocol (IGP) is a type of protocol used for
exchanging routing information between gateways (commonly routers)
within an autonomous system (for example, a system of corporate local
area networks). This routing information can then be used to route
network-layer protocols like IP.

Interior gateway protocols can be divided into two categories:
distance-vector routing protocols and link-state routing protocols.
Specific examples of IGPs include Open Shortest Path First (OSPF),
Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Intermediate System to Intermediate
System (IS-IS) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).
