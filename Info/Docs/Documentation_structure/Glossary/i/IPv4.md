# IPv4


Internet Protocol version 6

Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the Internet
Protocol (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based
internetworking methods in the Internet, and was the first version
deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. It still routes most
Internet traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of a successor
protocol, IPv6. IPv4 is described in IETF publication RFC 791 (September
1981), replacing an earlier definition (RFC 760, January 1980).

IPv4 is a connectionless protocol for use on packet-switched networks.
It operates on a best effort delivery model, in that it does not
guarantee delivery, nor does it assure proper sequencing or avoidance of
duplicate delivery. These aspects, including data integrity, are
addressed by an upper layer transport protocol, such as the Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP).\
