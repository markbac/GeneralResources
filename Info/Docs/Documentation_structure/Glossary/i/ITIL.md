# ITIL


TIL (formerly an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure
Library) is a set of detailed practices for IT service management (ITSM)
that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business. In its
current form (known as ITIL 2011), ITIL is published as a series of five
core volumes, each of which covers a different ITSM lifecycle stage.
Although ITIL underpins ISO/IEC 20000 (previously BS 15000), the
International Service Management Standard for IT service management,
there are some differences between the ISO 20000 standard, ICT Standard
by IFGICT and the ITIL framework.

ITIL describes processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists which are
not organization-specific or technology-specific, but can be applied by
an organization for establishing integration with the organization's
strategy, delivering value, and maintaining a minimum level of
competency. It allows the organization to establish a baseline from
which it can plan, implement, and measure. It is used to demonstrate
compliance and to measure improvement.
