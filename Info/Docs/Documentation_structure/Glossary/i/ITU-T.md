ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector

The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is one of the
three sectors (divisions or units) of the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU); it coordinates standards for
telecommunications.

The standardization efforts of ITU commenced in 1865 with the formation
of the International Telegraph Union (ITU). ITU became a specialized
agency of the United Nations in 1947. The International Telegraph and
Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, from French: Comité Consultatif
International Téléphonique et Télégraphique) was created in 1956, and
was renamed ITU-T in 1993.
