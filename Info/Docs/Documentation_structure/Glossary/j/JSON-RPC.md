# JSON-RPC


JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON. It is a
very simple protocol (and very similar to XML-RPC), defining only a few
data types and commands. JSON-RPC allows for notifications (data sent to
the server that does not require a response) and for multiple calls to
be sent to the server which may be answered out of order.
