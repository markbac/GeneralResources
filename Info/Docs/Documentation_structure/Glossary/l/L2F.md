# L2F


Layer 2 Forwarding

L2F, or Layer 2 Forwarding, is a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco
Systems, Inc.Â to establish virtual private network connections over the
Internet. L2F does not provide encryption or confidentiality by itself;
It relies on the protocol being tunneled to provide privacy. L2F was
specifically designed to tunnel Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) traffic.
