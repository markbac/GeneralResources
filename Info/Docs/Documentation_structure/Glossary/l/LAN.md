Local Area Network

A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects
computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory,
university campus or office building. By contrast, a wide area network
(WAN) not only covers a larger geographic distance, but also generally
involves leased telecommunication circuits.\
