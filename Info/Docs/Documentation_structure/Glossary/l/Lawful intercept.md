# Lawful intercept


Lawful interception (LI) refers to the facilities in telecommunications
and telephone networks that allow law enforcement agencies with court
order or other legal authorization to selectively wiretap individual
subscribers. Most countries require licensed telecommunications
operators to provide their networks with Legal Interception gateways and
nodes for the interception of communications. The interfaces of these
gateways have been standardized by telecommunication standardization
organizations.

With the legacy public switched telephone network (PSTN), wireless, and
cable systems, lawful interception (LI) was generally performed by
accessing the mechanical or digital switches supporting the targets'
calls. The introduction of packet switched networks, softswitch
technology, and server-based applications the past two decades
fundamentally altered how LI is undertaken.

Lawful interception differs from the dragnet-type mass surveillance
sometimes done by intelligence agencies, where all data passing a
fiber-optic splice or other collection point is extracted for storage or
filtering. It is also separate from the data retention of metadata that
has become a legal requirement in some jurisdictions.
