# MAC Address


Media Access Control Address

A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is a unique
identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for
communications at the data link layer of a network segment. MAC
addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network
technologies, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi. In this context, MAC
addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer.

A MAC may be referred to as the burned-in address (BIA). It may also be
known as an Ethernet hardware address (EHA), hardware address or
physical address (not to be confused with a memory physical address).

A network node may have multiple NICs and each NIC must have a unique
MAC address. Sophisticated network equipment such as a multilayer switch
or router may require one or more permanently assigned MAC addresses.

MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a NIC and
are stored in its hardware, such as the card's read-only memory or some
other firmware mechanism. A MAC address may include the manufacturer's
organizationally unique identifier (OUI). MAC addresses are formed
according to the rules of one of three numbering name spaces managed by
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE): MAC-48,
EUI-48, and EUI-64.\[1\]\[2\] EUI is an abbreviation for Extended Unique
Identifier.
