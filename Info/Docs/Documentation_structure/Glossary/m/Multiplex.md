# Multiplex


In telecommunications and computer networks, multiplexing (sometimes
contracted to muxing) is a method by which multiple analog or digital
signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium. The aim is to
share a scarce resource. For example, in telecommunications, several
telephone calls may be carried using one wire. Multiplexing originated
in telegraphy in the 1870s, and is now widely applied in communications.
In telephony, George Owen Squier is credited with the development of
telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910.

The multiplexed signal is transmitted over a communication channel such
as a cable. The multiplexing divides the capacity of the communication
channel into several logical channels, one for each message signal or
data stream to be transferred. A reverse process, known as
demultiplexing, extracts the original channels on the receiver end.

A device that performs the multiplexing is called a multiplexer (MUX),
and a device that performs the reverse process is called a demultiplexer
(DEMUX or DMX).
