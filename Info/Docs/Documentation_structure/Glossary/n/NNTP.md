Network News Transfer Protocol

The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is an application protocol
used for transporting Usenet news articles (netnews) between news
servers and for reading and posting articles by end user client
applications. Brian Kantor of the University of California, San Diego
and Phil Lapsley of the University of California, Berkeley wrote RFC
977, the specification for the Network News Transfer Protocol, in March
1986. Other contributors included Stan O. Barber from the Baylor College
of Medicine and Erik Fair of Apple Computer.

Usenet was originally designed based on the UUCP network, with most
article transfers taking place over direct point-to-point telephone
links between news servers, which were powerful time-sharing systems.
Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles
directly from the local disk.

As local area networks and Internet participation proliferated, it
became desirable to allow newsreaders to be run on personal computers
connected to local networks. The resulting protocol was NNTP, which
resembled the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) but was tailored for
exchanging newsgroup articles.
