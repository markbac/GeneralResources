# Node B


Node B is the telecommunications node in particular mobile communication
networks, namely those that adhere to the UMTS standard. The Node B
provides the connection between mobile phones (UEs) and the wider
telephone network. UMTS is the dominating 3G standard.

Node B corresponds to BTS (base transceiver station) in GSM.

Functionality\
This is the hardware that is connected to the mobile phone network that
communicates directly with mobile handsets. In contrast with GSM base
stations, Node B uses WCDMA/TD-SCDMA as the air interface technology. As
in all cellular systems, such as UMTS and GSM, the Node B contains radio
frequency transmitter(s) and the receiver(s) used to communicate
directly with mobile devices, which move freely around it. In this type
of cellular network, the mobile devices cannot communicate directly with
each other but have to communicate with the NodeB.

Traditionally, the Node Bs have minimum functionality, and are
controlled by an RNC (Radio Network Controller). However, this is
changing with the emergence of High Speed Downlink Packet Access
(HSDPA), where some logic (e.g., retransmission) is handled on the Node
B for lower response times.
