Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access

Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) is a multi-user
version of the popular orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)
digital modulation scheme. Multiple access is achieved in OFDMA by
assigning subsets of subcarriers to individual users. This allows
simultaneous low-data-rate transmission from several users
