# Process


A standard method for performing an *activity* or *task*.\
Processes may or may not be documented; a defined process implies that
it is documented. Processes are often supported by materials, tools,
conventions, and other infrastructure. The terms process may also refer
to the execution of the activities and tasks that make up the process,
e.g., "the outcome of the build process".
