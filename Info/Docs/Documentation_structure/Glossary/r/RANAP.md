# RANAP


Radio Access Network Application Part

In telecommunications networks, RANAP (an acronym for Radio Access
Network Application Part) is a protocol specified by 3GPP in TS 25.413
and used in UMTS for signaling between the Core Network, which can be a
MSC or SGSN, and the UTRAN. RANAP is carried over Iu-interface.

RANAP signalling protocol resides in the control plane of Radio network
layer of Iu interface in the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication
System) protocol stack. Iu interface is the interface between RNC (Radio
Network Controller) and CN (Core Network). nb. For Iu-ps transport RANAP
is carried on SCTP if IP interface used on this.

RANAP handles signaling for the Iu-PS - RNC and 3G SGSN and Iu-CS - RNC
and 3G MSC . It also provides the signaling channel to transparently
pass messages between the User Equipment (UE) and the CN.

In LTE, RANAP has been replaced by S1AP.
