# RTP


Real-time Protocol

The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a network protocol for
delivering audio and video over IP networks. RTP is used extensively in
communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media,
such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC,
television services and web-based push-to-talk features.

RTP typically runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). RTP is used in
conjunction with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). While RTP carries the
media streams (e.g., audio and video), RTCP is used to monitor
transmission statistics and quality of service (QoS) and aids
synchronization of multiple streams. RTP is one of the technical
foundations of Voice over IP and in this context is often used in
conjunction with a signalling protocol such as the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) which establishes connections across the network.
