# Regular expression


A regular expression, regex or regexp (sometimes called a rational
expression) is, in theoretical computer science and formal language
theory, a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually
this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for "find" or
"find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.
