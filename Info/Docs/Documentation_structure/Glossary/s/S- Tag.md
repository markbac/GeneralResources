# S- Tag


Service VLAN Tag

The IEEE standard 802.1ad provides for double-tagging by service
providers so that they can use VLANs allocated internally together with
traffic already tagged as VLANs by service provider customers.

In this double tagging, the S-Tag comes first followed by the C-Tag
(customer tag). The standard 802.1ad specifies a TPID of 0x88a8 for the
outer S-Tag.\
