software configuration management

In software engineering, software configuration management (SCM or S/W
CM) is the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software,
part of the larger cross-disciplinary field of configuration
management.\[2\] SCM practices include revision control and the
establishment of baselines. If something goes wrong, SCM can determine
what was changed and who changed it. If a configuration is working well,
SCM can determine how to replicate it across many hosts.
