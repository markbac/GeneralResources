# Semaphore


In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type
used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a
concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. Semaphore is
simply a variable. This variable is used to solve critical section
problems and to achieve process synchronization in the multi processing
environment.

A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example,
incremented or decremented, or toggled) depending on programmer-defined
conditions.

A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in the real-world systems
is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available,
coupled with operations to adjust that record safely (i.e.Â to avoid race
conditions) as units are required or become free, and, if necessary,
wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.

Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions;
however, their use is by no means a guarantee that a program is free
from these problems. Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count
are called counting semaphores, while semaphores which are restricted to
the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are
called binary semaphores and are used to implement locks.
