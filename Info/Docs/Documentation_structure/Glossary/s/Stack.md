# Stack


The protocol stack or network stack is an implementation of a computer
networking protocol suite or protocol family. The terms are often used
interchangeably; strictly speaking, the suite is the definition of the
Communications protocols, and the stack is the software implementation
of them.

Individual protocols within a suite are often designed with a single
purpose in mind. This modularization makes design and evaluation easier.
Because each protocol module usually communicates with two others, they
are commonly imagined as layers in a stack of protocols. The lowest
protocol always deals with low-level interaction with the communications
hardware. Every higher layer adds more features and capability. User
applications usually deal only with the topmost layers (see also OSI
model)\
