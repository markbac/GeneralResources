# Subversion


Apache Subversion (often abbreviated SVN, after its command name svn) is
a software versioning and revision control system distributed as open
source under the Apache License. Software developers use Subversion to
maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code,
web pages, and documentation. Its goal is to be a mostly compatible
successor to the widely used Concurrent Versions System (CVS).
