# Tcsh


tcsh is a Unix shell based on and compatible with the C shell (csh). It
is essentially the C shell with programmable command-line completion,
command-line editing, and a few other features. Unlike the other common
shells, functions cannot be defined in a tcsh script and the user must
use aliases instead (as in csh). It is the native root
shell for BSD-based systems such as FreeBSD.

tcsh added filename and command completion and command line editing
concepts borrowed from the Tenex system, which is the source of the "t".
Because it only added functionality and did not change what was there,
tcsh remained backward compatible with the original C shell. Though it
started as a side branch from the original source tree Joy had created,
tcsh is now the main branch for ongoing development. tcsh is very stable
but new releases continue to appear roughly once a year, consisting
mostly of minor bug fixes.
