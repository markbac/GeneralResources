User Agent

In computing, a user agent is software (a software agent) that is acting
on behalf of a user. One common use of the term refers to a web browser
telling a website information about the browser and operating system.
This allows the website to customize content for the capabilities of a
particular device, but also raises privacy issues.

There are other uses of the term "user agent". For example, an email
reader is a mail user agent. In many cases, a user agent acts as a
client in a network protocol used in communications within a
client--server distributed computing system. In particular, the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) identifies the client software
originating the request, using a user-agent header, even when the client
is not operated by a user. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
protocol (based on HTTP) followed this usage. In the SIP, the term user
agent refers to both end points of a communications session.
