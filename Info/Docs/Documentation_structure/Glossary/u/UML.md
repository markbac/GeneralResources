# UML


The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental,
modeling language in the field of software engineering, that is intended
to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to
standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software
design. It was developed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson and James
Rumbaugh at Rational Software in 1994--1995, with further development
led by them through 1996.

In 1997 UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group
(OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005 UML
was also published by the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) as an approved ISO standard.\[2\] Since then the standard has been
periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML.

Design\
UML offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a
diagram, including elements such as:

- any activities (jobs);

- individual components of the system;

- and how they can interact with other software components;

- how the system will run;

- how entities interact with others (components and interfaces);

- external user interface.

    Although originally intended for object-oriented design
    documentation, UML has been extended to a larger set of design
    documentation (as listed above),and been found useful in many
    contexts.
