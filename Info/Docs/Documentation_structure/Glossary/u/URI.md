# URI


Uniform Resource Identifier

URIs encompasses both URLs, URNs, and other ways to indicate a resource.

An example of a URI that is neither a URL nor a URN would be a data URI
such as data:,Hello%20World. It is not a URL or URN because the URI
contains the data. It neither names it, nor tells you how to locate it
over the network.

There are also uniform resource citations (URCs) that point to meta data
about a document rather than to the document itself. An example of a URC
would be an indicator for viewing the source code of a web page:
view-source:

<http://example.com/>

. A URC is another type of URI that is neither URL nor URN.
