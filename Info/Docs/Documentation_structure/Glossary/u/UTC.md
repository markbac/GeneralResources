# UTC


Coordinated Universal Time

Coordinated Universal Time or Universal Time Coordinated (abbreviated to
UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks
and time. It is within about 1 second of mean solar time at 0Â°
longitude, and does not observe daylight saving time. For most purposes,
UTC is considered interchangeable with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but
GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community.
