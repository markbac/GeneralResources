Voice Activity Detection

Voice activity detection (VAD), also known as speech activity detection
or speech detection, is a technique used in speech processing in which
the presence or absence of human speech is detected. The main uses of
VAD are in speech coding and speech recognition. It can facilitate
speech processing, and can also be used to deactivate some processes
during non-speech section of an audio session: it can avoid unnecessary
coding/transmission of silence packets in Voice over Internet Protocol
applications, saving on computation and on network bandwidth.

VAD is an important enabling technology for a variety of speech-based
applications. Therefore, various VAD algorithms have been developed that
provide varying features and compromises between latency, sensitivity,
accuracy and computational cost. Some VAD algorithms also provide
further analysis, for example whether the speech is voiced, unvoiced or
sustained. Voice activity detection is usually language independent.
