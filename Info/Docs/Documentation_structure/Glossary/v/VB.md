Visual Basic

Visual Basic is a third-generation event-driven programming language and
integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft for its
Component Object Model (COM) programming model first released in 1991
and declared legacy during 2008. Microsoft intended Visual Basic to be
relatively easy to learn and use. Visual Basic was derived from BASIC
and enables the rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user
interface (GUI) applications, access to databases using Data Access
Objects, Remote Data Objects, or ActiveX Data Objects, and creation of
ActiveX controls and objects.

A programmer can create an application using the components provided by
the Visual Basic program itself. Over time the community of programmers
developed third-party components. Programs written in Visual Basic can
also use the Windows API, which requires external function declarations.
