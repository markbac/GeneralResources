Wide Area Network

A wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunications network or computer
network that extends over a large geographical distance/place. Wide area
networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.

Business, education and government entities use wide area networks to
relay data to staff, students, clients, buyers, and suppliers from
various locations across the world. In essence, this mode of
telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily
function regardless of location. The Internet may be considered a WAN.

Related terms for other types of networks are personal area networks
(PANs), local area networks (LANs), campus area networks (CANs), or
metropolitan area networks (MANs) which are usually limited to a room,
building, campus or specific metropolitan area respectively.\
