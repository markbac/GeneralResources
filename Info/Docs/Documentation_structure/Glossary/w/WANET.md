Wireless ad hoc network

A wireless ad hoc network (WANET) or MANET (Mobile ad hoc network) is a
decentralised type of wireless network. The network is ad hoc because it
does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure, such as routers in wired
networks or access points in managed (infrastructure) wireless networks.
Instead, each node participates in routing by forwarding data for other
nodes, so the determination of which nodes forward data is made
dynamically on the basis of network connectivity and the routing
algorithm in use.\
In the Windows operating system, ad-hoc is a communication mode
(setting) that allows computers to directly communicate with each other
without a router.\
Wireless mobile ad hoc networks are self-configuring, dynamic networks
in which nodes are free to move. Wireless networks lack the complexities
of infrastructure setup and administration, enabling devices to create
and join networks "on the fly" -- anywhere, anytime.
