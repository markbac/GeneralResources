# WPA2


Wi-Fi Protected Access

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) are
two security protocols and security certification programs developed by
the Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks. The Alliance
defined these in response to serious weaknesses researchers had found in
the previous system, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).

WPA (sometimes referred to as the draft IEEE 802.11i standard) became
available in 2003. The Wi-Fi Alliance intended it as an intermediate
measure in anticipation of the availability of the more secure and
complex WPA2, which became available in 2004 and is a common shorthand
for the full IEEE 802.11i (or IEEE 802.11i-2004) standard.
