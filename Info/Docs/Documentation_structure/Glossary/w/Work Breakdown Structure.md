# Work Breakdown Structure


WBS

A representation of all work (*activities* and *tasks*) on a project,
decomposed into *work packages*. The *WBS* provides the fundamental
project management view of a project. Smaller projects may capture their
WBS implicitly in *work plans* or *detailed schedules*. Larger projects
will often define the *WBS* as a separate artifact.
