# Work Package


WP

A leaf element of a *WBS,* often defined as a tangible deliverable.
Bottom-up project estimation and planning is driven by work packages and
is often captured in a *work plan*. *Work packages* are normally broken
down into *activities* and *tasks* for *task estimation* and *detailed
scheduling*.
