# X.25


X.25 is an ITU-T standard protocol suite for packet switched wide area
network (WAN) communication. An X.25 WAN consists of packet-switching
exchange (PSE) nodes as the networking hardware, and leased lines, plain
old telephone service connections, or ISDN connections as physical
links.

X.25 was originally defined by the International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and
finalized in a publication known as The Orange Book in 1976.

X.25 networks were popular during the 1980s with telecommunications
companies and in financial transaction systems such as automated teller
machines. However, most uses have moved to internet protocol (IP)
systems instead. X.25 is still used (e.g., as of 2012 in the credit card
payment industry) and available in niche applications.
