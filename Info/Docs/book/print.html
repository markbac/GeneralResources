<p><em>Architecture need not be a monologue; delivered top-down from the minds and mouths of a centralised few.

<h2 id="when-traditional-approaches-to-architecture-break-down"><a class="header" href="#when-traditional-approaches-to-architecture-break-down">When &quot;traditional&quot; approaches to architecture break down</a></h2>
<p>I'll be honest, “traditional” approaches to software architecture (i.e. non-coding, decision-taking, diagram-drawing) are hard for me to make work at the best of times. But while using them in the world of continuously delivering autonomous teams I’ve repeatedly found myself faced with an impossible task: to be everywhere, tolerating significant contextual variance, and blocking no-one.</p>
<p>It made me wonder. Was there an alternative?</p>
<p>There was: I stopped taking architectural decisions. Completely.</p>
<p>In this article I’ll introduce this alternative mindset and the associated set of tools and practices which allow me to upend the traditional role of a “Software Architect” while simultaneously bringing the practice of software architecture to the fore across development teams. More importantly, I’ll explain how, within this alternative approach, everyone can do the architecting they need, safely and efficiently, without everything descending into chaos. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html#footnote-anarchy">[1]</a></p>
<p><strong>We need more ways to “do” architecture, not less.</strong></p>
<p>The moves in software delivery towards ever-increasing team autonomy have, in my mind at least, heightened the need for more architectural thinking combined with alternative approaches to architectural decision-making.</p>
<p>Ensuring our software teams experience true autonomy raises a key problem: how might a small group of architects feed a significant number of hungry, value-stream-aligned teams? Why? Because in this environment Architects <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html#footnote-inc-me">[2]</a> now need to be in many, many more places at once, doing all that traditional &quot;architecture&quot;.</p>
<p>What we need is a workable way to approach the human-scaling challenges of team autonomy and the architectures which manifest as a result.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this article I’ll introduce an alternative way of doing and governing architecture. I’ll explain in detail what it is, how it works, and how you might adopt it yourself. Most importantly, I’ll highlight how to fail, in order that you might succeed.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-fundamental-element-decision-making-via-the-advice-process"><a class="header" href="#the-most-fundamental-element-decision-making-via-the-advice-process">The most fundamental element: decision-making via the “Advice Process”</a></h2>
<p>Let’s take as our starting point a team which we aim to make maximally independent. Clearly this team will need somehow to engage in architectural thinking and decision-taking, but how?</p>
<p>These “many centres of decision making” are precisely what we need, yet straight away it’s clear that traditional, top-down architecture, with a select group of all-powerful architects taking all the decisions, runs contrary to such a decentralised model. “And yet”, the challenge is voiced “decisions still need to be made - that’s what architecture is”, and these skeptics are right.</p>
<p>These architectural decisions must still be made deliberately - otherwise we’ll be back where we started, or worse. Therefore, the first aspect in this alternative approach, it’s core element in fact, must describe how it delivers on decision-making. It’s called the “Advice Process”.</p>
<p>The Advice Process is the core element of this anarchist, decentralised approach to architecture. It’s greatest quality is it’s remarkably simplicity. It comprises one rule, and one qualifier:</p>
<p><strong>The Rule:</strong> anyone can make an architectural decision.</p>
<p><strong>The Qualifier:</strong> before making the decision, the decision-taker must consult two groups: The first is everyone who will be meaningfully affected by the decision. The second is people with expertise in the area the decision is being taken.</p>
<p>That’s it. That’s the Advice Process in its entirety.</p>
<p>This apparent straightforwardness hides however a key concept which it’s worth making explicit; while decision-takers are in no way obliged to agree with the advice the folks in these two consulted groups give them, they must seek it out, and they must listen to and record it. We are not looking for consensus here, but we are looking for a broad range of inputs and voices.</p>
<p>A challenge frequently raised against this concerns just how many people must be consulted. It is a valid concern, but a mitigatable one. When deploying this technique we create a checklist to help those in the decision-making seat identify who to speak to, and in which regard. InfoSec impacted? Talk to the CISO. Getting close to PII? Engage Mary in the data team and Vanessa in legal. A potential change to the user onboarding flow? Talk to your UX lead. About to adopt a new cloud service? Chat to Kris the cloud architect. Thinking about a change to your API? Speak to all the leads of the teams who are your consumers.</p>
<p>Sometimes this list of consultees can be a long one. That’s fine. Some decisions are large ones, and the advice-scope is a clear indication of both size and import. Sometimes decisions can be made smaller in scope and many consequently are. Other times the sheer number of folks impacted makes the decide-ee think again. Is this thing which might make their life a little bit easier really worth the effort of consulting all those people? Or, can they split this large decision into multiple, smaller decisions? When decisions do proceed, they are frequently right-sized purely as a matter of expediency. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html#footnote-econ-decisions">[3]</a></p>
<p>Can we push the Advice Process further? Yes we can, and we ought. I always encourage those following it to specifically seek out those who will disagree with them. Freed from the need to agree with what they hear, they inevitably engage far more seriously. Consequently the depth and breadth of advice received is greater. Decisions don’t tend to suffer as a consequence either. Neither does their learning.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the broader topic of benefits of the Advice Process. When deployed, I have always seen better, faster, more accountable decisions, and most importantly decisions which are understood and owned by those who implement them, precisely because the decidee is the one with the need as well as the one who is accountable.</p>
<p>As a side-effect, the pool of available decision-takers also grows, each of whom will soon be on the look-out for decisions which need to be made, and, given the feeling of empowered safety that the Advice Process gives them, flag them up and drive them to conclusion. The fact that a team's need for a decision to be taken can be met by themselves also leads to appropriate levels of bias-to-action, with accountability acting as a brake when it's required.</p>
<p>By working in this way we remove both the need for a fixed and permanent hierarchy and an abiding master decision-taker. It is for these two reasons that the Advice Process is the most fundamental element of this approach to architecture, because decentralised decision-making is the core element of anything which aspires to call itself “anarchistic”.</p>
<p>But wait, did we just remove in one fell swoop all need for we “traditional” architects? Not at all, but clearly our role has changed. In the following sections of this article - which introduces the supporting elements of this approach - we will see a set of rejuvenated practices and tools which allow us to get the teams, and the businesses they underpin, where they need to be.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to these supporting elements it is useful to take a short detour to highlight and discuss the one thing that all the remaining elements to this decentralised approach share, and also have in common with the core element: their focus on conversation, and it’s role in efficiently arriving at, and spreading, shared understanding.</p>
<h3 id="the-fundamental-role-of-conversations"><a class="header" href="#the-fundamental-role-of-conversations">The fundamental role of conversations</a></h3>
<p>Alberto Brandolini, inventor of Event Storming famously quipped “it is the developer’s assumptions which get shipped to production” and he’s right; it’s primarily what a developer understands about a target architecture that matters, not what is in the head or diagrams of a lead architect. This problem is age-old. Eric Evans tackled it in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321125215&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20">Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a>” and more recently my colleague Erik Dörnenberg has spoken about it in his presentation “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVyt3qQ_7TA">Architecture without Architects</a>”.</p>
<p>To me, it is this architecture, the one which is in the heads of those writing the code, that is the most important. In adopting this decentralised approach, where the practice of architectural decision-making is much more dispersed, this problem is in many ways, mitigated.</p>
<p>That’s something which helps me sleep at night.</p>
<p>However this decentralised, anarchistic approach then places front and centre another problem which all architectures must address: the delivery of a coherent whole. Here, we would seem to be at a disadvantage with our alternative approach. If everyone is empowered to make a decision, how do we, the “traditional” architects and ones who perhaps care most about the overall end result, ensure that the sum of all the individual decisions combine to form a coherent whole? How might we incorporate a longer-term perspective into those same decisions? And how might we support those who suddenly find themselves taking on levels of responsibility for which they might not feel comfortable?</p>
<p>Fortunately, another practitioner, and thinker in this space, Ruth Malan, has seen this before and shares the answer in her article “Do we still need architects?”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[In order for an architecture to be successful] it is very much about ensuring that conversations that are needed to be happening are happening - not always initiating them, nor always helping to focus or navigate them, but ensuring they do happen […] and guiding when needed</p>
<p>-- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201222143814/https://www.ruthmalan.com/Journal/2016/2016JournalFebruary.htm#Still_Need_Architects">Ruth Malan</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our adoption of the Advice Process opened up the space for anyone to make decisions, but it has also put conversations, the responsibility to seek out expertise, and think about impact at the core. The remainder of the elements of this approach, each of which supports the core element focus specifically on ensuring those conversations are as timely, focused and effective as possible. There are four of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>a thinking and recording tool</li>
<li>a time and place for conversations;</li>
<li>a light to illuminate and guide towards a unified direction;</li>
<li>a means to sense the current technical landscape and climate.</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll cover each of these in turn in a few seconds, but first I need to clarify two things.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-strategy-and-cross-functional-requirements"><a class="header" href="#what-about-strategy-and-cross-functional-requirements">What about strategy and cross-functional requirements?</a></h3>
<p>It's worth a few sentences on what isn't covered in this approach: technical strategy and cross-functional requirements (CFRs).</p>
<p>Clearly both are essential for all software endeavors of any meaningful size:</p>
<p>A well evangelized strategy can help the organization advance by having decentralized teams prioritize technical activities which are best aligned with the org's maturity and needs. Clearly the best technical decisions are those which support the strategy, and when this is the case this can be called out clearly.</p>
<p>A clear set of testable CFRs also helps a decentralised set of teams ensure that they look beyond their immediate, local delivery, and meet the minimum requirements for playing coherently in the shared ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, technical governance refers to both these rather than encompassing them - they contribute to the context within which it operates - and so I've not gone into any detail on them here. But what does governance include beyond a means to ensure good technical decisions? Let's take a look.</p>
<h2 id="the-four-supporting-elements"><a class="header" href="#the-four-supporting-elements">The Four Supporting Elements</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-a-thinking-and-recording-tool-decision-records"><a class="header" href="#1-a-thinking-and-recording-tool-decision-records">1. A thinking and recording tool: Decision Records</a></h3>
<p>The first supporting element is <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records">Architectural Decision Records</a> or ADRs. These are lightweight documents, frequently stored in source code repositories alongside the artefacts they describe. Now, there are a variety of formats which various adopters have chosen to champion, but the key elements which I insist on are as follows: <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html#footnote-two-more">[4]</a></p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>title</td><td>which includes a unique identifier, and the decision itself (e.g. “ADR001 - Use AKS for Kubernetes Pods”)</td></tr>
<tr><td>status</td><td>typically “Draft”, “Proposed”, “Adopted”, “Superseded” and “Retired”</td></tr>
<tr><td>decision</td><td>the decision that has been taken in a few sentences (frequently bold or italicized so it stands out)</td></tr>
<tr><td>context</td><td>the forces and current contextual circumstances which have necessitated this decision</td></tr>
<tr><td>options considered</td><td>each option considered, described briefly, with pros and cons. (Typically the option proposed / adopted comes first in this list)</td></tr>
<tr><td>consequences</td><td>the ramifications of this decision, both positive and negative</td></tr>
<tr><td>advice</td><td>this reflects the raw outputs from following the Advice Process. It is here that all advice given is recorded. This ought to include the name of the advice giver, and the date the advice was given. This can frequently take the forms of comments, and if these are provided directly by the advice-giver, then recording the meta-data is automatic.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>I’ve found in practice that having such a lightweight ADR template structure is not only a great way to record architectural decisions - it also helps teams learn to make architectural decisions. These key elements operate like a thinking checklist, and prompt the decide-ee regarding what they need to think about, and more importantly have conversations about.</p>
<p>What’s more, ADRs serve to reinforce the Advice Process by making it a requirement on ADR authors to capture and record all advice they get. I also encourage authors to engage with this advice directly in their ADR options section, whether they choose to follow it or not. It is one thing to seek advice and write it down. It is quite another to actively wrestle with it. The fruits get sweeter the more you engage.</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise to learn that consequently, a series of ADRs, and their surrounding conversations provide an excellent learning ground for people wanting to begin to take on the task of decision-taking; everything is out in the open, including the dissent and compromise-making. Less experienced practitioners of architecture can peruse the history of what went before them quickly and easily, see good (and quite likely less-good) examples, and see decisions being taken (and perhaps also being revoked when circumstances change / the team learned more). They are almost a thinking and decision lore for a set of software, written in the hand of those who contributed most to it.</p>
<p>While sadly I can’t share with you examples of these conversations I’ve had with my clients, there are some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210506014629/https://upmo.com/dev/decisions/0010-som-synthetic-monitoring.html">great examples</a> of ADRs out on the public internet, courtesy of Thoughtworks-alumni Wisen Tanasa and his startup <a href="https://upmo.com/">Upmo</a>. I’d encourage you to take a look. They come <a href="https://twitter.com/mtnygard/status/1315647651854135297?lang=en">blessed by none other than Michael Nygard himself</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-a-time-and-place-for-conversations-the-architecture-advisory-forum"><a class="header" href="#2-a-time-and-place-for-conversations-the-architecture-advisory-forum">2. A time and place for conversations: The Architecture Advisory Forum</a></h3>
<p>The second supporting element in this alternative approach exists to make all the conversations supporting this advice-seeking easier: a weekly, hour-long Architecture Advisory Forum (“AAF”).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, this is a regular and recurring place and time for conversations. Your ideal attendees are delegates from each team as well as your key representatives from your Advice Process checklist. However, the invite should remain completely open to encourage transparency and openness. The timeliness and quality of the conversations which take place is a key indicator of success, but equally important is the breadth and diversity of views shared, and the same goes for the contributors. If architecture is being “done” here, and lessons shared and learned, then you’re winning.</p>
<p>The standing agenda typically begins as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>team representatives quickly share new <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html">spikes</a> (giving early warning of probable future decisions and allow the attendees to share existing knowledge and experience)</li>
<li>discussions about each new “proposed” decision (presented by those making the decision, captured ahead of time in the form of an ADR)</li>
<li>a re-visit of other decision-statuses (we timebox these, both to limit the window for incoming advice, and also to allow us to revisit a decision which we made with imperfect information)</li>
<li>a look at our collective four key metrics, our cloud spend trends, and finally</li>
<li>any other business (aka “AOB”)</li>
</ul>
<p>A cursory glance might give the impression that an AAF is just a new title for a standard meeting. The one typically known as a “Tech Advisory Board”, “Architecture Decision Forum” or “Architecture Review Board”. There are however several key differences.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Advice Process reigns. Decisions taken to the AAF are still owned and made by the originators. The only thing other attendees can do is offer advice, or suggest additional people to seek advice from. Hence the name.</p>
<p>This brings us to the second key difference. Given the Advice Process qualifiers, the invitees to the AAF are those typically affected / possessing relevant expertise. This means those typically present include representatives from each feature team (and not just the lead; BAs/POs and QAs are frequently present), people from other programmes of work, UX, Product, Operations, and occasionally senior execs.</p>
<p>The combination of these two differences leads us to the third, and most important key difference: the conversations. The Advice Process is great, but it’s conversations can frequently be 1-1. When they take place in an AAF there is an audience, so many people can listen and everyone can learn. The amount of organisational, domain, legacy, and experiential information and architectural skill-deployment shared at these sessions is unlike anything I have ever seen, and despite being a potentially dry meeting, it is the most well-attended, and most broadly participated hour of our week. It is one of the most significant contributors to the quest for a learning organisation that there is. AAFs encourage disagreement, and celebrate failure / changes of decision based on lessons learned. This all combines to broaden and deepen the general understanding of an architecture, virtually guaranteeing it ends up in the running software.</p>
<h3 id="3-a-light-to-illuminate-a-unified-goal-team-sourced-architectural-principles"><a class="header" href="#3-a-light-to-illuminate-a-unified-goal-team-sourced-architectural-principles">3. A light to illuminate a unified goal: Team-sourced Architectural Principles</a></h3>
<p>Having architectural principles is not new, though sadly I rarely encounter serviceable ones. Always important, in a world of highly-autonomous-teams they become essential because they are the means by which an aligned delivery direction is achieved without the need for control.</p>
<p>So what makes a good architectural principle? Firstly, it must provide a criteria with which to evaluate our architectural decisions (which in practice means it must be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and testable, aka “S.M.A.R.T”). Secondly, it must support the business’s strategic goals. Thirdly, it must articulate the consequences / implications it necessarily contains within it. Finally, taken together as a set, they should number neither too few to cover the key needs which architectural principles meet, nor too many that teams cannot remember them all.</p>
<p>There is a great deal I could write here about bad architectural principles but I’ll stick to the key aspects. Firstly, they are not practices. Practices are how you go about something, such as following TDD, or Trunk Based Delivery, or Pair Programming. This is not to say that practices are bad (indeed Dr Forsgren’s “Accelerate” is full of recommendations regarding for their set of circumstances) they’re just not architectural principles.</p>
<p>Watch out for slipping into the other end of the scale too - general principles. “Keep it simple” and “Don’t repeat yourself” are principles, but they’re not architectural. Nor are the various principles you’ll see around project planning, and software quality management. What we need are means to direct and evaluate our architectural practice and decisions. What we need is something which helps me pick between <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html#IntegrationApproaches">various approaches to implementing micro-frontends</a>, or helps me decide if it really makes sense to <a href="https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-4/oauth/index.html#OSP">hand-roll my own OAuth 2.0 implementation</a>, or guides me in evaluating self-hosted <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> on AWS vs <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">Amazon Elastic Search Service</a>.</p>
<p>Given all this, now let’s share a good principle, based around the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TeamTopologies.html">Team Topologies</a> “Stream-Aligned Team” organisation model:</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Value independence of teams most highly</p>
<p><strong>Subtitle:</strong> Split solutions along team lines</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The strength of our approach to building and running our products relies fundamentally on the independence of our teams. The downsides to this are acknowledged, but the upsides are felt to outweigh it, especially when the difficulty of predicting future needs is taken into consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Duplication of both function, and data, will inevitably arise. Rather then fight this, we embrace it, acknowledging the need, in certain circumstances, for noticeable eventual consistency and data replication</li>
<li>The combined licencing, runtime and support costs of multiple third-party solutions may be higher than the costs of a single, shared, cross-product-team solution</li>
<li>Solutions can be designed for the needs of the team which owns and runs them. They need not concern themselves the needs of other teams</li>
<li>Both systems and the third-party services / solutions they are build on will tend to be smaller, and more specific-task-focussed</li>
<li>Teams who go their own way need to self-support any third-party services / solutions which they adopt independently</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to see more examples, please have a look at the publicly-available <a href="http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/">John Lewis “Software Engineering Principles”</a>. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html#footnote-jl-non-principles">[5]</a></p>
<p>So far, so general. Nothing I have said so far in this section would be controversial in any approach to architecture. Why then am I stressing these points so much? Not only is the importance of architectural principles heightened in this decentralised approach, but also everyone concerned needs to know how to structure them and what good looks like because they will be sourced from, and maintained by, the teams themselves.</p>
<p>Our approach is, to a great extent, taken directly from the excellent <a href="http://theartofscalability.com/">“The Art of Scalability”</a> by Abbot and Fisher. While their book assumes a slightly more top-down, hierarchical approach to architecture than presented here, the authors very much recognise the impact of the human element on their topic. In fact, the edition I read had been significantly re-written to give more weight to this perspective. One key aspect of this is their argument that for any architectural principle to be successful, teams which deliver against them need to feel a sense of ownership over it.</p>
<p>I’d encourage you to take a look at their book for a wealth of detail on how to source these from the collective. Suffice it to say, when presented with the business’s strategic goals, the “S.M.A.R.T.” criteria from earlier, and a broad set of invitees from across technology and beyond (yet again your AAF invitee list will prove invaluable here) you will rapidly and collectively arrive at 8-15 principles which will serve you well. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html#footnote-jad-arb">[6]</a> It’s well worth capturing the adoption of a principle as an ADR. These will be very lightweight (don’t fall into the trap of repeating the principle itself) offering a great opportunity to articulate why this principle is important.</p>
<p>There is one final point to make on the principles. Remember that this approach is aimed at supporting team autonomy, so one key role played by our principles is as a minimal viable set of understandings and agreements between everyone. This raises a key point, because one thing we ask teams to explicitly flag in their ADRs is not just the principles which apply, but also when their decision conflicts with one or more principles. This becomes a great point to engage the Advice Process and the power of the collective at the AAF to really get all the best minds and varied perspectives on the problem, and then record all this in the ADR. Yet again, the various elements support each other, amplifying their benefits, and helping us get to successful architectures. Remember, if, as a consequence of this a principle changes, call that out as a separate ADR that supersedes the original.</p>
<p>That’s architectural principles covered, which play the role of a guiding light for everyone to aim for, but how do we also take note of our surrounding landscape and climate? Architectural decisions are also frequently based on what everyone else is doing, who has which skills, and what the general trends in the tech industry are. Enter the fourth and final supporting element: your own Technology Radar.</p>
<h3 id="4-a-tech-landscape-and-current-climate-sensing-tool---your-own-tech-radar"><a class="header" href="#4-a-tech-landscape-and-current-climate-sensing-tool---your-own-tech-radar">4. A tech landscape and current climate sensing tool - Your own Tech Radar</a></h3>
<p>Many people have heard of the ThoughtWorks <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">Technology Radar</a> - an opinionated guide to current trends (predicted, current, and receding) in software languages and frameworks, tools, platforms, and techniques. It’s strengths lie in how it visually represents both the current landscape and the movements of various “blips” across it, allowing viewers to very rapidly see (for example) what is up and coming in the world of front-end frameworks, what’s current flavour of the month, and what’s beginning to fade.</p>
<p>Sadly, far fewer know about the fact you can <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/byor">build your own radar</a>. The “BYOR” allows you, as a collective, to capture and map out your local version of the technology trends you see across your organisation. It’s very configurable too. In my most recent usage we kept the quadrants (Techniques, Tools, Platforms and Languages &amp; Frameworks) but changed the rings to reflect the transit of technologies through our programme of work (they became “experiment”, “adopt”, “hold” and finally “retire”).</p>
<p>As with the architectural principles, these radar blips need to be crowd-sourced in a workshop. The first run of this will capture everything you have now in your organisation - a baseline sweep or scan if you will. Prior to this you need to figure out how wide you will go (org-wide? just your project? Will you include disciplines such as Ops and UX? etc.) and what your quadrants will be. It’s also possible to add extra fields for data capture, but I typically try to keep it simple. The first time you do this it can take a fair time (we’ve taken four hours and more before) but this is because it is essential that you involve all team members, not just architects, and the end result will give a great overview of the landscape and prevailing climate, and brings many discussions about where effort should be directed, and where it should be reduced. And just as with the principles, give rise to a general aligning of team understanding.</p>
<p>What about the usage of your radar? As with the principles, there is also a place in our ADRs for “Relevant Radar Blips”. This is where we flag both adherence to the existing landscape as reflected in the current radar, but also, and more importantly, potential changes to the existing radar which this decision will introduce. Perhaps it’s the spiking of a new framework, or a move from “experiment” to “adopt” for a specific practice.</p>
<p>Again, this is great grist for the AAF discussion forum, and great content to capture in the ADR itself. You can even go so far as linking specific types of blip appearances and movements to the need to submit ADRs, though in my experience this happens anyway without anyone having to push it explicitly. Remember, your goals here are the broadest engagement with your evolving architecture as possible, as well as a growing architectural mindset across all team members.</p>
<p>How about keeping your radar up to date? I've seen quarterly cadences work, and half-yearly too. The key is to pay attention to how the radar is being consumed (or not) at the AAF and elsewhere. That should give you a good idea when it's worth investing in a refresh.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-typically-works-in-practice"><a class="header" href="#how-this-typically-works-in-practice">How this typically works in practice</a></h2>
<p>Given all this, how might you see it all working in practice? Let’s take a look…</p>
<p>When the need for an architectural decision first arises it will most likely be vague and possibly poorly understood. It’s therefore great to open up a new ADR template right away and start trying to fill it in.</p>
<p>First to be tackled is the “context” section. To attempt this we need to understand the “why” of our decision as well as surrounding forces which we need to balance. We’ll probably rapidly realise we need to do some research to be able to complete even this short section.</p>
<p>Early ports of call in this research ought to be the architectural principles and radar. The principles, you’ll recall, give us an idea of the direction of travel which our ideal solution will ideally manifest. Not all will be relevant, but some principles ought to help our decision-making. Recall that it’s an architectural principal’s primary goal to assist in the evaluation of multiple technical possibilities, and highlight the one which fits best.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the experience will be a little different. One alternative is that a relevant principle cannot help you pick between two options, then there is either very little difference to choose between, or potentially, your principle isn’t S.M.A.R.T. enough. This is a good reason to revisit the principle and re-define it.</p>
<p>The other alternative also may end, perhaps a little later, in a re-evaluated set of principles. These arise when in order to make your decision you feel inclined to contravene one or more principles. That’s ok; good decisions can go against the principles, but to do so you’ll need to state clearly why this course of action was the right step to take. Overriding a principle is a significant step because it means we are effectively diverging from the general direction of travel. Consequently, the decision, and resulting ADR must be clearly argued and strongly justified. It might also signal the time to revisit the principle in light of this development.</p>
<p>The radar in comparison is a lot more advisory in nature. It will give an idea of what, if anything, is the current de-facto standard in our problem space, what’s been done in the past, and what other teams might be experimenting with. Going a different way is a lot less likely to raise eyebrows, but it is again a definite reason to address the deviation in the ADR.</p>
<p>Given all this, we can start to come up with our key criteria to evaluate options against, as well as a list of alternatives. Perhaps we’ve realised we really need to do some homework and in which case we might spin off a timeboxed Spike to learn more about something. Our ADR thinking will help write super-clear acceptance criteria here. If we don’t need to do a Spike, we will think instead about seeking advice.</p>
<p>Having these inputs from the context (which will include, for example, a technical strategy), applicable principles, radar blips, and key criteria / alternatives will in turn help us think about who to speak to for advice. In my experience it is helpful to engage in this when you are relatively confident you understand the problem space / need, but before you become too attached to a specific solution. When you go and seek advice, spend most time and effort speaking to people who will disagree with you; those who you know think along different lines and where you know you will have blind spots. Not only this, challenge yourself. Consider “what’s bad about this alternative? What are its shortcomings?” Spend the most time thinking about the alternatives which challenge your decision most directly and fundamentally.</p>
<p>Before you have the discussion, it helps to have the ADR ready in a rough form, and share it with them in advance. This will give them thinking time. Then when you do meet, go through every element of the ADR template. Have you missed something from the context? From the principles / blips? From the evaluation criteria? Solicit and capture their advice on all these things. More importantly, ask them why they are making these suggestions. It is the answers to these questions that the keys to learning to make better architectural decisions lie. Your advisors will help you understand how they see problems, what they’ve encountered that was similar in the past, and even entire aspects which you don’t even think about. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html#footnote-hiring-pain">[7]</a></p>
<p>What about the AAF? Isn’t that the place to gather advice? Yes, and everything I’ve shared above should guide you wherever you have the conversation, but for the first few decisions a team or individual takes it really helps to have these in a more targeted way with the key advisors. The ADR you present before the AAF will then be really solid and focused before it is shared widely, meaning that the resulting AAF conversations will be richer and more focused. Sometimes a quick conversation in the AAF will lead to a subsequent, more in depth, 1-1 conversation.</p>
<p>Remember, once you have advice, wherever it came from, you must roll it into your ADR. You need not take the advice given, but you have to record it. An excellent practice here is to prioritise things in your writing which people would find non-intuitive or surprising. If you disagree with key advice, state how and why. If you are doing something new, make it clear why the current way doesn’t work for you. Remember to use the principles. Sometimes they will support your decision. Make it clear how. Sometimes you will have to contravent them. Make it clear why. Your goal is to make the reader understand why you took the decision you took. If you meet this goal, then you will not just have a solid decision, you’ll most likely have learned a great deal in the process. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/scaling-architecture-conversationally.html#footnote-adr-equiv-blogs">[8]</a></p>
<p>Before I close this section, remember, all decisions are point-in-time, and no-one can ever foresee every eventuality, but you want to be able to go back later and still feel good about a decision, given what you knew / understood at the time. In this, the context and criteria you capture are key. This re-visiting of decisions is another great learning tool. With the benefit of hindsight you can now ask questions such as: “did we understand the context well enough?” and “were we honest enough with ourselves about what we knew and what we didn’t?”</p>
<h2 id="how-to-fail"><a class="header" href="#how-to-fail">How to fail</a></h2>
<p>So that’s the extent of our alternative, decentralised, anarchistic approach to architecture, and an idea of how it typically all fits together. But before we conclude, we ought to address one final aspect - the key ways in which you can fail. Let’s enumerate them.</p>
<p>The majority of failures you will see will actually be good ones - mini failures as decisions are taken by those who are less experienced. These are good because the process facilitates quick decisions, by those who need them, and more importantly, it facilitates transparency and rapid identification of failures (as those who took the decision will be aware of the issues as they code it) and a safe means to re-visit, and share the learnings. Embrace these, calling them out specifically and celebrating them in the AAF. This is a key aspect of building a learning culture.</p>
<p>To learn most effectively you need to feel safe, and when learning collectively everyone benefits from the broadest, most diverse range of inputs contributing to discussions. Remember, in this approach, we are explicitly not looking for consensus, but we are looking for a broad range of inputs and voices. It is here that the next failure mode lies, and it is far more insidious and damaging than the first. This second failure mode arises when you, in your job as a conversation-starter and space-holder, fail to include all who ought to be contributing and deciding and learning. For a great part early adoption stages of this style of architecture can feel like great successes. “It’s working! More and more people are taking decisions, writing them up in ADRs, giving advice and discussing them in the AAF! I’ve never seen such engagement with principles before!”. Only later, on reflection, will you realise the gains could have been far greater. It is precisely when this first flush of satisfaction strikes that you must be most on your guard. Are you really observing mass participation and learning, or is it a core group of usual suspects? You mitigate this problem actively. Watch out for who contributes. Amplify voices and ensure others listen to the quieter contributors. Make sure influence is balanced and not based on reputation, tenure or place in the hierarchy. Actively encourage many viewpoints and highlight the value it brings so that it becomes self-sustaining.</p>
<p>The third failure mode is an early warning that you are encountering the preceding failure mode, however, this one lives more in the grey area between desired and unwelcome. As you proceed along this journey you will uncover off-the-grid decisions. Decisions which never came up at the AAF, and which never made it into an ADR. There are two ways to approach them. The first, correct way, is to treat the discovery as what you hope it is - an honest mistake, and an opportunity to learn and teach others. Perhaps the decide-ees weren’t even aware of the fact it was a key decision they were taking. Perhaps they were under pressure from elsewhere. Perhaps they thought it wasn’t as significant as it turned out to be. Perhaps they felt they would be shouted down in the AAF. Whatever the reason, treat it as a way for both them, and you, to learn. To improve the process. The other, wrong way to treat these, is to fall back to old ways, and take back control. Which takes us nicely to the failure mode which completely destroys this approach and all that it promises.</p>
<p>It’s easy to slip into this fourth and most dangerous failure mode, and so it needs constant vigilance on your part. The only thing which needs to happen to trigger this is for “capital-A” architects such as yourself to fail to trust people; it is to not practice what you preach; it is to not clear enough space for the mini failures and consequent learning opportunities just mentioned; it is to continue to perform “shadow architecture” behind the scenes to make sure things still go how you think they ought to, despite all the signals from elsewhere. The sole benefit of this failure mode is that it becomes evident very rapidly as all the benefits I’ve listed above fail to materialize.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering if it’s this key failure mode which makes this approach to architecture hard to pull off you’d be right. I have been lucky in the past. Colleagues have called me out when I’ve made decisions for others, and I’ve caught myself getting frustrated that folks don’t know what I know. But then I realise I’m failing in my real task as a practitioner of architecture - I’m failing to get the right conversations happening, with the right people, at the right time. Remember that (perhaps even task others with calling you out when you fail to stick to the process) and you’ll be surprised how easy (and satisfying) it is to succeed.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-elements-again-and-possible-further-steps"><a class="header" href="#the-five-elements-again-and-possible-further-steps">The five elements again, and possible further steps</a></h2>
<p>Given we now have both the good and the (potentially) bad, as well as a collection of failure modes to look out for, let’s conclude. We recall we have the five elements of our alternative approach to architecture:</p>
<p>One core element: Advice Process</p>
<p>Four supporting elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture Advisory Forum</li>
<li>Lightweight ADRs</li>
<li>Team-sourced Principles</li>
<li>Your own Tech Radar</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully I’ve made it clear that while none of the elements may be new to you (aside from perhaps the Advice Process) there is something very different. This difference lies in the interplay/mutual reinforcement between all of these against a backdrop of conversations, learning and safety. What is hopefully enticing is the fact that, in my experience at least, this is far more likely to provide successfully deployed architectures, now, and into the future. It is my go-to for scaling myself, and making sure that the teams I work with deliver on the promises we have made to our users, which is, after all, the goal.</p>

<p>One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of design docs for defining software designs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.</p>
<p>As software engineers our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text, like in the form of a design doc, may be the better tool for solving problems early in a project lifecycle, as it may be more concise and easier to comprehend, and communicates the problems and solutions at a higher level than code.</p>
<p>Besides the original documentation of a software design, design docs fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.</li>
<li>Achieving consensus around a design in the organization.</li>
<li>Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns.</li>
<li>Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization.</li>
<li>Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.</li>
<li>Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="anatomy-of-a-design-doc"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-a-design-doc">Anatomy of a design doc</a></h1>
<p>Design docs are informal documents and thus don’t follow a strict guideline for their content. Rule #1 is: Write them in whatever form makes the most sense for the particular project.</p>

The goal is that readers are brought up to speed but some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to. This section should be entirely focused on objective background facts.</p>
<h1 id="goals-and-non-goals"><a class="header" href="#goals-and-non-goals">Goals and non-goals</a></h1>
<p>A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. Note, that non-goals aren’t negated goals like “The system shouldn’t crash”, but rather things that could reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. A good example would be “ACID compliance”; when designing a database, you’d certainly want to know whether that is a goal or non-goal. And if it is a non-goal you might still select a solution that provides it, if it doesn’t introduce trade-offs that prevent achieving the goals.</p>

<p>This section should start with an overview and then go into details.

<p>The design doc is the place to write down the trade-offs you made in designing your software. Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value. That is, given the context (facts), goals and non-goals (requirements), the design doc is the place to suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals.</p>
<p>The point of writing a document over a more formal medium is to provide the flexibility to express the problem set at hand in an appropriate manner. Because of this, there is no explicit guidance for how to actually describe the design.</p>
<p>Having said that, a few best practices and repeating topics have emerged that make sense for a large percentage of design docs:</p>
<h1 id="system-context-diagram"><a class="header" href="#system-context-diagram">System-context-diagram</a></h1>
<p>In many docs a system-context-diagram can be very useful. Such a diagram shows the system as part of the larger technical landscape and allows readers to contextualize the new design given its environment that they are already familiar with.</p>

<h1 id="apis"><a class="header" href="#apis">APIs</a></h1>
<p>If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that API is usually a good idea. In most cases, however, one should withstand the temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of date. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p>
<h1 id="data-storage"><a class="header" href="#data-storage">Data storage</a></h1>
<p>Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. Similar to the advice on APIs, and for the same reasons, copy-pasting complete schema definitions should be avoided. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p>
<h1 id="code-and-pseudo-code"><a class="header" href="#code-and-pseudo-code">Code and pseudo-code</a></h1>
<p>Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to prototypes that show the implementability of the design.</p>
<h1 id="degree-of-constraint"><a class="header" href="#degree-of-constraint">Degree of constraint</a></h1>
<p>One of the primary factors that would influence the shape of a software design and hence the design doc, is the degree of constraint of the solution space.</p>
<p>On one end of the extreme is the “greenfield software project”, where all we know are the goals, and the solution can be whatever makes the most sense. Such a document may be wide-ranging, but it also needs to quickly define a set of rules that allow zooming in on a manageable set of solutions.</p>
<p>On the other end are systems where the possible solutions are very well defined, but it isn’t at all obvious how they could even be combined to achieve the goals. This may be a legacy system that is difficult to change and wasn’t designed to do what you want it to do or a library design that needs to operate within the constraints of the host programming language.</p>
<p>In this situation you may be able to enumerate all the things you can do relatively easily, but you need to creatively put those things together to achieve the goals. There may be multiple solutions, and none of them are really great, and hence such a document should focus on selecting the best way given all identified trade-offs.</p>
<h1 id="alternatives-considered"><a class="header" href="#alternatives-considered">Alternatives considered</a></h1>
<p>This section lists alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes. The focus should be on the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the design that is the primary topic of the document.</p>
<p>While it is fine to be succinct about solution that ended up not being selected, this section is one of the most important ones as it shows very explicitly why the selected solution is the best given the project goals and how other solutions, that the reader may be wondering about, introduce trade-offs that are less desirable given the goals.</p>
<h1 id="cross-cutting-concerns"><a class="header" href="#cross-cutting-concerns">Cross-cutting concerns</a></h1>
<p>This is where your organization can ensure that certain cross-cutting concerns such as security, privacy, and observability are always taken into consideration. These are often relatively short sections that explain how the design impacts the concern and how the concern is addressed. Teams should standardize what these concerns are in their case.</p>
<p>Due to their importance, Google projects are required to have a dedicated privacy design doc, and there are dedicated reviews for privacy and security. While the reviews are only required to be completed by the time a project launches, it is best practice to engage with privacy and security teams as early as possible to ensure that designs take them into account from the ground up. In case of dedicated docs for these topics, the central design doc can, of course, reference them instead of going into detail.</p>
<h1 id="the-length-of-a-design-doc"><a class="header" href="#the-length-of-a-design-doc">The length of a design doc</a></h1>
<p>Design docs should be sufficiently detailed but short enough to actually be read by busy people. The sweet spot for a larger project seems to be around 10-20ish pages. If you get way beyond that, it might make sense to split up the problem into more manageable sub problems. It should also be noted that it is absolutely possible to write a 1-3 page “mini design doc”. This is especially helpful for incremental improvements or sub tasks in an agile project–you still do all the same steps as for a longer doc, just keep things more terse and focused on a limited problem set.</p>
<h1 id="when-not-to-write-a-design-doc"><a class="header" href="#when-not-to-write-a-design-doc">When not to write a design doc</a></h1>
<p>Writing design docs is overhead. The decision whether to write a design doc comes down to the core trade-off of deciding whether the benefits in organizational consensus around design, documentation, senior review, etc. outweigh the extra work of creating the doc. At the center of that decision lies whether the solution to the design problem is ambiguous–because of problem complexity or solution complexity, or both. If it is not, then there is little value in going through the process of writing a doc.</p>
<p>A clear indicator that a doc might not be necessary are design docs that are really implementation manuals. If a doc basically says “This is how we are going to implement it” without going into trade-offs, alternatives, and explaining decision making (or if the solution is so obvious as to mean there were no trade-offs), then it would probably have been a better idea to write the actual program right away.</p>
<p>Finally, the overhead of creating and reviewing a design doc may not be compatible with prototyping and rapid iteration. However, most software projects do have a set of actually known problems. Subscribing to agile methodologies is not an excuse for not taking the time to get solutions to actually known problems right. Additionally, prototyping itself may be part of the design doc creation. “I tried it out and it works” is one of the best arguments for choosing a design.</p>
<h1 id="the-design-doc-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#the-design-doc-lifecycle">The design doc lifecycle</a></h1>
<p>The steps in the lifecycle of a design document are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creation and rapid iteration</li>
<li>Review (may be in multiple rounds)</li>
<li>Implementation and iteration</li>
<li>Maintenance and learning</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="creation-and-rapid-iteration"><a class="header" href="#creation-and-rapid-iteration">Creation and rapid iteration</a></h1>
<p>You write the doc. Sometimes together with a set of co-authors.</p>
<p>This phase quickly evolves into a time of rapid iteration where the doc is shared with colleagues who have the most knowledge about the problem space (often belonging to the same team) and through their clarifying questions and suggestions drive the doc to a first relatively stable version.</p>
<p>While you certainly find engineers and even teams who prefer version control and code review tools for document creation, the vast majority of design docs at Google are created in Google Docs and make heavy use of its collaboration features.</p>
<h1 id="review"><a class="header" href="#review">Review</a></h1>
<p>In the review phase a design doc gets shared with a wider audience than the original set of authors and close collaborators. Reviews can add a lot of value, but they are also a dangerous trap of overhead, so treat them wisely.</p>
<p>A review can take many shapes: The more lightweight version is simply sending out the doc to the (wider) team-list to give folks a chance to take a look. Discussion then primarily happens in comment threads in the document. On the heavy side of reviews, are formal design review meetings in which the author presents the doc (often via a dedicated presentation) to an often very senior engineering audience. Many teams at Google have recurring meetings scheduled for this purpose to which engineers can sign up to for a review. Naturally waiting for such meetings to happen can significantly slow down the development process. Engineers can mitigate this by seeking the most crucial feedback directly and not blocking progress on wider review.</p>
<p>When Google was a smaller company, it was customary to send designs to a single central mailing list, where senior engineers would review them at their own leisure. This may very well be a great way to handle things for your company. One benefit was that it did establish a relatively uniform software design culture across the company. But as the company scaled to a much larger engineering team, it became infeasible to maintain the centralized approach.</p>
<p>The primary value that such reviews add is that they form an opportunity for the combined experience of the organization to be incorporated into a design. Most consistently, ensuring that designs take cross-cutting concerns such as observability, security and privacy into account is something that can be ensured in a review stage. The primary value of the review isn’t that issues get discovered per-se, but rather that this happens relatively early in the development lifecycle when it is still relatively cheap to make changes.</p>
<h1 id="implementation-and-iteration"><a class="header" href="#implementation-and-iteration">Implementation and iteration</a></h1>
<p>When things have progressed sufficiently to have confidence that further reviews are unlikely to require major changes to the design, it is time to begin implementation. As plans collide with reality, it is inevitable that shortcomings, unaddressed requirements, or educated guesses that turned out to be wrong surface, and require changing the design. It is strongly recommended to update the design doc in this case. As a rule of thumb: If the designed system hasn’t shipped yet, then definitely update the doc. In practice we humans are bad at updating documents, and for other practical reasons changes are often isolated into new documents. This leads to an eventual state more akin to the US constitution with a bunch of amendments rather than one consistent piece of documentation. Links to such amendments from the original doc can be immensely helpful for the poor future maintenance programmer trying to understand their target system through design doc archaeology.</p>
<h1 id="maintenance-and-learning"><a class="header" href="#maintenance-and-learning">Maintenance and learning</a></h1>
<p>When Google engineers get confronted with a system that they hadn’t previously touched their first question often is “Where is the design doc?”. While design docs, like all documentation, tend to get out of sync with reality over time, they still often present the most accessible entry point to learn about the thinking that guided the creation of the system.</p>
<p>As the author, do yourself a favor and re-read your own design docs a year or 2 later. What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What would you do to decide differently today? Answering these questions is a great way to advance as an engineer and improve software design skills over time.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions"><a class="header" href="#conclusions">Conclusions</a></h1>
<p>Design docs are a great way to gain clarity and achieve consensus around solving the hardest problems in a software project. They save money, because they avoid going down coding rabbit holes that fail to achieve project goals and could have been avoided using upfront investigation; and they cost money, because creation and review take time. So, choose wisely for your project!</p>
<p>When considering writing a design doc, think about these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you unsure about the right software design, and would it make sense to spend upfront time to gain certainty?</li>
<li>Relatedly, would it help to involve senior engineers, who might not be able to review every code-change, in the design?</li>
<li>Is the software design ambiguous or even contentious such that achieving organizational consensus around it would be valuable?</li>
<li>Does my team sometimes forget to consider privacy, security, logging or other cross-cutting concerns in the design?</li>
<li>Is there a strong need for documents that provide high-level insights into the design of legacy systems in the organization?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answer yes to 3 or more of these questions, then a design doc is probably a great method to start your next software project.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="john-lewis-software-engineering-principles"><a class="header" href="#john-lewis-software-engineering-principles">John Lewis Software Engineering Principles</a></h1>
<p>We have created a set of Software Engineering principles that we use internally that form a common belief in how software should be built within John Lewis IT Delivery. They can be found here <a href="http://engineering-principles.jl-engineering.net/">http://engineering-principles.jl-engineering.net/</a></p>
<h2 id="why-create-a-set-of-principles"><a class="header" href="#why-create-a-set-of-principles">Why create a set of Principles?</a></h2>
<p>The success of our organisation is dependent on implementing outstanding software solutions in a sustainable way. Rather than simply declaring that “Engineering Excellence” is important to us, we embarked on creating a set of principles that describe what that means to us in practice.</p>
<h2 id="principles-instead-of-policy-or-standards"><a class="header" href="#principles-instead-of-policy-or-standards">Principles instead of policy or standards</a></h2>
<p>When creating the principles we didn’t want to dictate how each engineering team should build their product by creating another policy document as we want teams to feel empowered. We also didn’t want this to become another document that was quietly ignored. On that basis we created the principles as a set of <em>beliefs</em> that are important to us as an organisation.</p>
<p>We wanted to create principles that are actionable rather than create a set of truisms that are easy to agree with but of no real value in practice. For each of the principles we describe why we believe it to hold true and the implications of actually working to the principle.</p>
<p>When we created the principles some of them were controversial. For example we created <strong>Cloud Native</strong> as a principle when almost all new projects were still hosting solutions on traditional infrastructure. As an organisation we now host most new solutions on cloud infrastructure. Maybe most controversially we created and then removed <strong>Reusable Components</strong> as a principle. Through experience we learned that the principles <strong>Design For Pace of Change</strong> and <strong>Evolutionary Systems</strong> set out our real intent, which is that while reuse is often valuable, inappropriate reuse inhibits change and should emerge through evolution rather than being designed up front.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-we-create-the-principles"><a class="header" href="#how-did-we-create-the-principles">How did we create the principles?</a></h2>
<p>Inside John Lewis IT we have a serious sounding body we call the Tech Council which is a bunch of experienced developers that meet up once a week to discuss anything about our organisation’s engineering approach. The Tech Council created the initial principles, hosting them in Git and setting up a CD pipeline to publish them to a website whenever they are changed. The principles are “open sourced” internally so anybody can suggest improvements by making a merge request.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/architectural_principles/image-3.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>We always share the principles with any new Partners or suppliers we use. We have had valuable contributions from some very well known figures from the world of agile software development that have worked with us recently, some of whom have shared our principles with their other clients (which we are very happy about).</p>
<h2 id="how-have-the-principles-impacted-our-organisation"><a class="header" href="#how-have-the-principles-impacted-our-organisation">How have the principles impacted our organisation?</a></h2>
<p>We never wanted them to be another document that gathered dust in the filing cabinet. They are used as part of the training for anybody up-skilling to be a software engineer within our organisation, which on its own is great.</p>
<p>But they have also been used to resolve the inevitable disagreements about engineering approach that crop up in a large organisation. The principles are a simple way to evaluate how differing opinions align themselves to our organisational beliefs, and if our beliefs are not shared we would rather resolve that first.</p>
<p>Engineering teams often create their own charters about how they will approach the engineering problem in their particular context. They have found it useful to validated their charters against the principles instead of creating their own value system.</p>
<h2 id="what-next-for-our-principles"><a class="header" href="#what-next-for-our-principles">What next for our principles?</a></h2>
<p>We have recently started a process of evaluating how well engineering teams are aligned with the principles. I say <em>aligned</em> rather than <em>comply with</em> as the intent is to help teams rather than judge them. This will also help us as an organisation to understand how well we are performing and where we may need to make investment choices to improve our engineering performance.</p>
<p>A member of the Tech Council helps each team to evaluate itself and we have a guide to help with the evaluation process which includes things such as positive and negative indicators for each principle. Rather than give each team a total score out of 100 we use a red/amber/green traffic light against each principle.</p>
<p>We expect the evaluation process and the principles themselves to improve as we gain more experience with this.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-software-architecture"><a class="header" href="#what-is-software-architecture">What is Software Architecture?</a></h1>
<p><em><strong>Software architecture</strong></em> is the process of defining the high-level structure and organization of a software system. It involves identifying and selecting the right components, deciding how they should interact with each other, and determining how they should be organized to achieve specific goals. The goal of software architecture is to create a system that is maintainable, scalable, and secure, and that can meet the needs of users and organizations over time.</p>
<h1 id="why-do-we-need-software-architecture"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-software-architecture">Why do we need Software Architecture?</a></h1>
<p>A robust architecture provides a solid foundation for building software that meets the needs of users and stakeholders. It ensures that the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, and reliability. With a well-designed architecture, developers can build software that is easy to modify and extend, making it easier to adapt to changing business needs.</p>
<p>Software architecture is also essential for managing complexity. As software systems become more complex, it becomes challenging to understand how different components interact with each other. A well-designed architecture provides a high-level view of the system, making it easier to understand its structure and operation. This, in turn, helps developers to identify potential issues and make informed decisions about how to modify the system.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-we-document-architecture-we-use-4c-model"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-document-architecture-we-use-4c-model"><strong>How do we Document Architecture? We use 4C Model.</strong></a></h1>
<h2 id="context-level"><a class="header" href="#context-level">Context Level</a></h2>
<p>At the highest level, the Context level, we describe the system’s external environment, such as users, other systems, regulations, etc. This level provides a high-level overview of the system’s purpose and its relationship to the external world. It helps to identify the stakeholders who will interact with the system and the factors that will influence its design and development.</p>
<h2 id="containers-level"><a class="header" href="#containers-level">Containers level</a></h2>
<p>The next level is the Containers level, which describes the runtime environment of the system, such as servers, databases, or message queues. This level helps to identify the major technology choices and deployment decisions. It provides an understanding of the physical infrastructure that will support the system and the tools and resources that will be required to deploy and maintain it.</p>
<h2 id="components-level"><a class="header" href="#components-level">Components level</a></h2>
<p>The third level is the Components level, which describes the major functional building blocks of the system. This level helps to identify the modules, classes, or functions that make up the system. It provides an understanding of the system’s functionality and the relationships between its different components.</p>
<h2 id="code-level"><a class="header" href="#code-level">Code level</a></h2>
<p>Finally, the Code level is the lowest level, which describes the actual code and how it implements the components. This level provides a detailed understanding of how the system works and how its different components interact with each other. It is essential for developers who will be working with the code to have a clear understanding of how it is structured and how it works.</p>
<p>Using the C4 model, software architects can create diagrams and written documentation that describe each of these levels, providing a comprehensive view of the system’s architecture. This approach helps to identify potential issues and trade-offs, as well as facilitating scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. By documenting the architecture in this way, developers and stakeholders can have a clear and easy-to-understand view of the system, making it easier to modify and extend as business needs change.</p>

<h2 id="1-client-server"><a class="header" href="#1-client-server">1. Client Server</a></h2>
<p>The client-server architecture is a model in which the client, a user or an application, sends a request to the server, which in turn responds with the requested data or service. The client and server can be on the same machine or on different machines connected through a network.</p>
<p>The client is responsible for initiating communication with the server and sending a request. The server, on the other hand, listens for incoming requests from clients, processes them, and returns a response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Advantages of Client-Server Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Scalability:</strong></em> Client-server architecture is highly scalable, as it allows multiple clients to connect to the same server and share resources.</p>
<p><em><strong>Security:</strong></em> Client-server architecture provides better security than other network models, as the server can control access to resources and data.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reliability:</strong></em> Client-server architecture is highly reliable, as the server can provide backup and recovery services in case of failures.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="2-layering"><a class="header" href="#2-layering">2. Layering</a></h2>
<p>It’s a common way to design complex software systems, and it involves breaking down the system into layers, where each layer is responsible for a specific set of functions. This approach helps to organize code and makes it easier to maintain and modify the system over time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>A typical layering architecture consists of three main layers: presentation, business logic, and data access.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> The presentation layer is responsible for displaying information to the user and gathering input. This layer includes the user interface and any other components that interact directly with the user. The user interface is what the user sees and interacts with, such as buttons, text boxes, and menus. The presentation layer also includes any logic related to the user interface, such as event handlers and validation.</p>
<p><strong>Business Logic Layer:</strong> The business logic layer is responsible for implementing the business rules of the application. This layer contains the code that processes and manipulates data, as well as any other application logic. The business logic layer is where the magic happens, so to speak. It’s where the software performs calculations, makes decisions, and carries out tasks. This layer is where the software really earns its keep.</p>
<p><strong>Data Access Layer:</strong> The data access layer is responsible for interacting with the database or other external data sources. This layer contains the code that reads and writes data to and from the database. The data access layer is where the software retrieves data from the database, makes changes to the data, and saves the changes back to the database. This layer is critical to the functioning of the software, as it enables the software to store and retrieve data.</p>

<h2 id="3-pipe-and-filter"><a class="header" href="#3-pipe-and-filter">3. Pipe and Filter</a></h2>
<p>Pipe and Filter Architecture is a design pattern that allows software systems to process data by separating the processing tasks into multiple independent components. This architecture is particularly useful for systems that need to handle large amounts of data, as it can help to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability.</p>
<p>The Pipe and Filter Architecture is based on the idea of a pipeline, where data flows through a series of processing steps, each of which performs a specific task. Each processing step is implemented as a separate component, or filter, that accepts data as input, performs some operation on the data, and produces output data. The output data is then passed on to the next filter in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The filters in the pipeline are independent of each other, which means that they can be developed, tested, and deployed separately. This makes it easy to add new filters to the pipeline or modify existing ones without affecting the rest of the system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Benefits</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Scalability:</strong> The architecture can be scaled horizontally by adding more filters to the pipeline, which allows the system to handle larger amounts of data.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> The architecture can be optimized for performance by parallelizing the processing of data across multiple filters.</p>
<p><strong>Maintainability:</strong> The architecture promotes modularity and separation of concerns, which makes it easier to maintain and update the system over time.</p>

<h2 id="4-master-slave"><a class="header" href="#4-master-slave">4. Master-Slave</a></h2>
<p>Master-Slave architecture is a design pattern used in distributed systems, where one node (the master) controls one or more nodes (the slaves) to perform specific tasks. The master node is responsible for distributing the workload across the slaves and for coordinating their activities. The slave nodes do not have the same level of control as the master node and only perform tasks that are assigned to them by the master.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Benefits</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the most significant advantages is that it allows for the efficient distribution of workload across multiple nodes. This helps to reduce the load on any one node and ensures that the system can handle large amounts of data and traffic.</p>
<p>Another advantage of using a master-slave architecture is that it provides fault tolerance. If one of the slave nodes fails, the master node can redistribute its workload to the other slave nodes. This ensures that the system can continue to function even if one or more nodes fail.</p>

<h2 id="5-microkernel"><a class="header" href="#5-microkernel">5. MicroKernel</a></h2>
<p>MicroKernel architecture is a software design pattern that allows developers to build more modular and flexible systems. It separates the core system functionality from additional features, which are implemented in separate modules. The core functionality of the system is implemented in the MicroKernel, a minimalistic core system that provides only the most essential services required to run the system. It is plug and play concept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s consider the example of an e-commerce website. The MicroKernel would provide essential services such as handling user authentication, managing user sessions, and processing payments. Additional features, such as product recommendations, user reviews, and social media integration, would be implemented in separate modules.</p>
<p>If the website wants to add a new feature, such as a loyalty program, it can be developed and added as a separate module without affecting the core functionality of the system. This modularity makes it easier to add new features or remove existing ones without affecting the core system functionality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the website wants to customize its system to meet the specific needs of different users, it can choose the modules it needs for each user. For example, a user who frequently buys electronics can be provided with a module that recommends electronic products. On the other hand, a user who frequently buys cosmetics can be provided with a module that recommends cosmetic products.</p>
<p>Finally, if the website wants to scale its system to handle more users or changes in hardware, it can easily add or remove modules as needed. This scalability makes it easier to adapt the system to changes in user requirements or changes in the underlying hardware.</p>

<h2 id="6-ddd-domain-driven-design"><a class="header" href="#6-ddd-domain-driven-design">6. DDD (Domain Driven Design)</a></h2>
<p>At its core, DDD is a way of thinking about software architecture that emphasizes the domain or problem space of a project. This means that developers focus on the business logic of the software, rather than just the technical implementation.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that developers start by understanding the domain they are working in and break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. They then use this understanding to create a domain model, which is a representation of the different entities within the domain and how they interact with one another.</p>
<p>Once the domain model is created, developers can use it to guide the rest of the architecture of the software. This includes creating bounded contexts, which are areas of the software that are defined by a specific language and context, and aggregates, which are collections of related entities that are treated as a single unit.</p>
<h2 id="7-component-based"><a class="header" href="#7-component-based">7. Component Based</a></h2>
<p>In software engineering, component-based architecture (CBA) is an approach to software design and development that emphasizes the use of reusable software components. The idea behind CBA is that software development can be made more efficient and effective by breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is a component?</strong></p>
<p>A software component is a modular, self-contained unit of software that can be reused across different systems. A component typically has a well-defined interface, which specifies how other components can interact with it. This interface includes information about the component’s inputs, outputs, and behavior.</p>
<p>Components can be classified into different types based on their functionality, such as user interface components, data access components, and business logic components. Each type of component has a specific role in the software system and can interact with other components through their interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="8-soa"><a class="header" href="#8-soa">8. SOA</a></h2>
<p>SOA is an architectural style that aims to create modular, reusable services that can be easily integrated with other services to create a larger system. In this approach, services expose their functionality through interfaces, which can be accessed by other services or applications.</p>
<p>At its core, SOA is about building software by breaking it down into smaller pieces, or modules, that can be reused across different applications. This modular approach allows developers to focus on building specific pieces of functionality and then integrating them with other pieces to create a larger system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Core Components of SOA</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Service Provider:</strong> The service provider is responsible for creating and exposing services to the outside world. These services can be used by other services, applications, or end-users. For example, a payment processing service provider might create and expose a service that allows other applications to process payments.</p>
<p><strong>Service Registry:</strong> The service registry is a directory of available services that can be accessed by other services or applications. The service registry provides information about the service, such as its name, location, and interface. For example, if an application needs to process payments, it can use the service registry to find the payment processing service and access its interface.</p>
<p><strong>Service Requestor:</strong> The service requestor is responsible for consuming the services exposed by the service provider. This can be done by using the service registry to find the appropriate service and then invoking its interface. For example, an application might use the service registry to find the payment processing service and then use its interface to process payments.</p>

<h2 id="9-monolithic"><a class="header" href="#9-monolithic">9. Monolithic</a></h2>
<p>Monolithic architecture is a software design pattern that has been around for decades. It’s a way of structuring an application as a single, cohesive unit, rather than splitting it up into individual, smaller components.</p>
<p>In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. All of the code and dependencies are packaged together, so the application can be deployed and run on a single server.</p>
<p>This makes it easy to develop and deploy the application, since everything is in one place. It also makes it easier to scale the application horizontally, by adding more servers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Advantages of Monolithic Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of monolithic architecture is its simplicity. Since everything is contained in a single unit, there are fewer moving parts to worry about. This makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy the application.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that it’s easier to maintain and debug a monolithic application. Since everything is in one place, it’s easier to track down issues and fix them.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the biggest disadvantages of monolithic architecture is that it can be difficult to scale the application vertically. Since everything is running on a single server, there’s a limit to how much traffic the application can handle.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that it can be difficult to adopt new technologies and languages in a monolithic application. Since everything is packaged together, it can be hard to update individual components without breaking the entire application.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="10-microservice"><a class="header" href="#10-microservice">10. Microservice</a></h2>
<p>Microservice architecture is a style of software architecture that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Each service is focused on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of other services in the system.</p>
<p>The main idea behind microservice architecture is to break down a large, monolithic application into smaller, more manageable services. This approach brings several benefits, such as improved scalability, increased flexibility, and quicker time-to-market for new features. With a microservice architecture, each service can be scaled independently, making it easier to handle traffic spikes or changes in demand. Developers can also modify or add new services without affecting other parts of the system, which speeds up the development process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Challenges of Microservice Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p>Despite the benefits of microservice architecture, it also introduces additional complexity. One of the biggest challenges is managing inter-service communication. Services need to be able to discover each other and communicate effectively, which can be difficult to do at scale. Load balancing and fault tolerance are also more complex in a microservice architecture.</p>
<p>Another challenge is ensuring that each service has its own data store. In a monolithic application, all data is typically stored in a single database. With microservices, each service should have its own data store to ensure that changes to one service do not affect other services in the system. This can lead to increased complexity in data management and synchronization.</p>
<p><em><strong>Best Practices for Microservice Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p>To ensure the success of a microservice-based system, developers should follow best practices for designing and implementing microservices. Some of these best practices include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Design services that are loosely coupled and highly cohesive, with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use containerization technology, such as Docker, to package and deploy each service as a separate container. This allows for easy scaling and deployment of individual services as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement effective monitoring and management tools to ensure that the system is running smoothly and to detect and address issues quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a service mesh, such as Istio, to manage inter-service communication and load balancing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the testing and deployment of microservices.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="11-event-driven"><a class="header" href="#11-event-driven">11. Event Driven</a></h2>
<p>Event Driven Architecture (EDA) is an approach to designing software systems that enables rapid and efficient communication between different components or services. In this paradigm, different software components communicate with each other using events, rather than through direct requests or responses.</p>
<p>In EDA, events are generated by different components of a software system, such as a user interface or a backend service. These events are then broadcast to other components of the system, which can subscribe to them and act on them as needed.</p>
<p>For example, consider a simple e-commerce application. When a new order is placed, the order processing service can generate an “order created” event, which is then broadcast to other services such as inventory management, shipping, and billing. Each of these services can then process the event and make updates to their respective systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Benefits of EDA</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the key benefits of EDA is its ability to decouple different components of a software system. When different components communicate through events rather than direct requests, they become less dependent on each other. This makes it easier to change or update individual components of the system without affecting the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Another benefit of EDA is its scalability. Because events are broadcast to multiple components of the system, it is possible to process large volumes of data and transactions in parallel. This makes it easier to handle high traffic and spikes in demand.</p>
<p><em><strong>Challenges of EDA</strong></em></p>
<p>While EDA has many benefits, it also has some challenges. One of the main challenges is managing the complexity of event-driven systems. Because events can be generated and consumed by many different components, it can be difficult to track and debug issues that arise.</p>
<p>Another challenge is ensuring that events are processed in the correct order. Because events can be generated and processed asynchronously, it is possible for events to be processed out of order. This can cause issues such as data inconsistencies or incorrect calculations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="12-stream-based"><a class="header" href="#12-stream-based">12. Stream Based</a></h2>
<p>As software development becomes more complex and demands greater scalability, traditional architectures are becoming less and less effective. Stream-based architecture is emerging as a promising alternative that enables developers to build systems that can handle massive amounts of data in real-time.</p>
<p>At its core, stream-based architecture is based on the principles of event-driven programming. Instead of processing data in batches, stream-based systems process data as it is generated in real-time. This allows developers to build systems that can respond to changes in data with minimal latency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Benefit of Stream-Based Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the key benefits of stream-based architecture is its scalability. Because data is processed in real-time, stream-based systems can handle massive amounts of data without the need for complex batch processing pipelines. This makes it possible to build systems that can process millions of events per second, making it ideal for use cases like sensor data processing, financial trading, and online advertising.</p>
<p>Another benefit of stream-based architecture is its flexibility. Because data is processed in real-time, it is possible to build systems that can respond to changes in data with minimal latency. This makes it possible to build complex, event-driven systems that can adapt to changing business requirements. For example, in an e-commerce platform, stream-based architecture can be used to track user activity in real-time and respond with personalized recommendations and promotions based on the user’s browsing and purchasing history.</p>
<p>Furthermore, stream-based architecture can provide significant cost savings. Traditional batch processing pipelines require expensive hardware and complex software infrastructure to manage the data processing. On the other hand, stream-based systems can be built on inexpensive commodity hardware, making it much easier to scale and maintain.</p>
<p>Finally, stream-based architecture is highly fault-tolerant. Because data is processed in real-time, it is possible to build systems that can automatically recover from failures without the need for manual intervention. This makes it possible to build systems that can operate at scale with high levels of reliability, reducing the risk of data loss or system downtime.</p>

<p>As a software engineer, it is very important to acquire the skill of writing high-quality documentation. Due to the recent increase in remote work, it has become even more important to be better at asynchronous communication. Remote company GitLab does an excellent job of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">defining asynchronous communication</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Asynchronous communication is the art of communicating and moving projects forward without the need for additional stakeholders to be available at the same time your communique is sent.”</p>

<p>An informal introduction to Solution Architecture</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The term Solution Architecture refers to a high-level blueprint of a solution that was developed to solve one or more business problems within an enterprise using a technological approach. Building a proper solution architecture requires</p>
<ul>
<li>A good understanding of the business problem or problems (domain knowledge)</li>
<li>Comprehensive knowledge of the technologies used in the enterprise world (technical knowledge)</li>
<li>Experience in building similar solutions in the past (experience)</li>
</ul>
<p>A good solution architecture can be used to perform critical tasks such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing and implementing innovative solutions for the consumers of the business</li>
<li>Maintain excellent user experience with higher degrees of service availability</li>
<li>Perform calculations on return on investment (ROI) and total cost of ownership (TCO)</li>
</ul>
<p>Solution architecture tries to compact a gigantic set of details into a set of diagrams so that different stakeholders understand what is actually going on inside the enterprise software systems. It is helpful for highly technical people such as software developers, software architects, and CTOs as well we moderately technical people such as project managers, business analysts, and citizen developers.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-architectures-in-solution-architecture"><a class="header" href="#types-of-architectures-in-solution-architecture">Types of architectures in solution architecture</a></h2>
<p>The first step in solving any problem is understanding the business requirements of the client. To include all the critical information related to the business use case, we can come up with something called a “business architecture” which contains different types of applications, users, and their interactions at a very high level. We sometimes call this architecture “Level 0” architecture.</p>
<h3 id="business-architecture-level-0-architecture"><a class="header" href="#business-architecture-level-0-architecture">Business architecture (Level-0 architecture)</a></h3>
<p>The idea of business architecture is to come up with a possible solution to a real-world problem or problems and depict that in the form of a diagram or a document using the systems, applications, and users that are considered in the scenario with minimum technical details. This component is mainly useful for business executives and other non-technical stakeholders so that they can understand what technical solution is going to be built using this architecture. Given below is a “business architecture” diagram that we came up with for a mobile banking application.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Explanation/image-7.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Figure: The business architecture of a mobile banking application</p>
<p>The preceding figure depicts the various components associated with the solution in which we are building a mobile banking application for a given bank. It showcases the components such as gateway, integration, and security component as high-level building blocks to design a solution for this problem.</p>
<p>The next step in designing the solution architecture is to use this and design a technical architecture with the finer details about products and tools.</p>
<h3 id="technical-architecture-level-1-architecture"><a class="header" href="#technical-architecture-level-1-architecture">Technical architecture (Level-1 architecture)</a></h3>
<p>This is the type of diagram that includes details of specific vendors, products, and tools required to build a real-world software system using the business architecture blueprint. Coming up with a technical architecture requires the proper analysis of vendors and tools as well as the current and future business requirements and TCO/ROI calculations. The below diagram depicts a simplified version of a technical architecture for the business architecture we discussed before.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Explanation/image-6.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Figure: Technical architecture of a mobile banking solution</p>
<p>In this diagram, we have mentioned the specific vendors that we are going to use to fulfill the certain functionalities that we identified during the business architecture design phase. As an example, the diagram depicts that we are going to use the WSO2 API Manager solution as the API gateway which exposes the services to the mobile application. Similarly, it shows that we are going to use Mulesoft and Auth0 for respective functionalities. In addition to that, we can also depict information about which cloud platforms and container technologies we are going to use if we decided to go with a container-based solution.</p>
<p>Once the product vendors and tools are identified, the next step is to go further down into the actual deployment details and showcase the infrastructure level details that can be used by the developers as well as the operations teams to build the actual infrastructure for the solution.</p>
<h3 id="deployment-architecture-level-2-architecture"><a class="header" href="#deployment-architecture-level-2-architecture">Deployment architecture (Level-2 architecture)</a></h3>
<p>This architecture diagram showcases how the technical architecture looks like in a real computing infrastructure such as a data center or a cloud platform. It contains details on network-level segmentation, the number of replicas (instances), traffic routing components such as load balancers or firewalls, and many other details related to the actual deployment of the solution. The figure below depicts a simplified version of a deployment architecture that we can come up with for the mobile banking solution that we discussed before.</p>

<p>Any business exists to solve a real human problem. It could be to increase speed, reduce cost, improve convenience, add pleasure to life or make the knowledge available at the fingertips. Technology often used to solve these business problems. But then why the design patterns are important? Typical challenges with IT system are Availability, Scalability, Resiliency, Data Management, Performance and Security. Before going into design patterns it is important to get clarity of these words.</p>
<p><strong>Availability:</strong> Availability is the percentage of time system is up in a defined timeframe. A system can be down because of multiple reasons like software errors, network issues, load issues, DDos (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks and infrastructure hardware issues. Availability is measured as a percentage as below.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-30.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: In 2014, Flipkart - an Indian online retailer went on to <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Industry/t5UDgJyzPcvF7vK7j7M62O/Flipkart-apologizes-to-customers-for-mega-sale-glitches.html">apologise</a> to customers as big billion sale could not cope up with customer demands because of scalability issues. Scalability is a factor of computing resources, data storage needs, messaging infrastructure and cost. There are two ways to sort out scalability issues. The first one is vertical scaling where you would keep on increasing the capacity of the resources the second one is horizontal scalability where you add more nodes. There are pros and cons with either of these approaches. Typically, vertical scaling is faster, but has limitation beyond a certain point of time and horizontal scaling takes more time and offers close to infinity scaling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scalability is how the system resources can cope up with unpredictable customer demands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Resiliency:</strong> You went on to buy a watch on an e-commerce site. You did not like the design and you want to look for more options. You selected few dropdown boxes with design, color, price filters and clicked on search button. Now you would expect to see picture of the watch, price data, some specifications like Band Material Type, Watch Movement, Colour, Delivery Date. What if delivery date microservice was down that time? As an architect, you have multiple options now. Do not show that field at all, show a static message that “We are calculating the accurate delivery date, please be patient”, or you pick up a date range and show to the customer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resiliency is the ability of a system to gracefully handle the failures and recover from failures as soon as it can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Data Management:</strong> Data management plays a crucial role in scalability, availability, security and resiliency. Architectural decisions related to data management depends on what type of application you are building. Is it write heavy (more user transactions), read-heavy (reports), meant to do analytics (forecasting, customer segmentation), time series (log processing) or Datawarehouse (data analytics). Few other factors that would influence are data consistency, data availability, data storage and archival strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Scalability and performance are interrelated. If there are more users compared to what the system can handle, it is natural that the system would encounter performance issues. How to deal with this? Either you increase the resources or reduce the number of users. Of course, the second choice is not ideal because you would end up losing the business. In fact, we will sort out these performance issues when you sort out scalability issues. I just want to remind you, scalability can’t solve all the performance issues but can solve some issues. For example, if the performance issues are the result of badly written DB query, scaling the resources without fine-tuning the query will prove to be a disastrous decision.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Building secure systems gives an assurance to users that their data is in safe hands. Data integrity and data durability are equally important. It is very similar to when you put your money in the bank. If you deposited one million dollars in the bank, you do not want to lose that money (Safe), you would want the bank to always say you deposited one million -no mistakes here (Integrity) and even after 10 years you go to the bank, you will still have that one million dollars money (Durability).</p>
<p>As you now got the basics right, let's look at important patterns one by one. No design pattern is a magic pill for all the issues. One needs to choose depending on the use case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scalability and Performance</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>CQRS:</strong> Command Query Responsibility Segregation is first introduced by <a href="https://twitter.com/gregyoung">Greg Young</a>. As the name suggests it is about segregating the write and read responsibilities. Write and read can happen from a single database or multiple databases. But the data model is different. CQRS easily fits into event sourcing architecture. Consume the events as and when they occur and write into “Write DB”. For display or reporting purposes read from the “Read DB”. To make this even more exciting, you may use normalized RDBMS for write and denormalized NoSQL DB for “Read”. Commands are typically queued for asynchronous process and a query can never modify a DB. One very good benefit is you can independently scale the DBs</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Anti Corruption Layer pattern</strong>: This pattern was initially described by <a href="https://twitter.com/ericevans0">Eric Evans</a> in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Let me introduce this with a story. Martin and Sheela work in a retail chain. Martin works in the customer order team and Sheela works in Loyalty Card team. From the DDD perspective, Martin and Sheela belong to two different domains and typically they do not interact with each other. One day Sheela wanted to make a change in her system. The change is to know the location of the customer so that she can offer additional loyalty points based on the location. However, she doesn't know Martin. Even if she knows, Martin may not agree to her change as he has to change his API. However, she knows that Srinivas is Martin’s manager. She approaches Srinivas to make the change. In this case, Srinivas is an Anti-Corruption Layer. This pattern is typically used when you have legacy systems and modern applications and you are in the journey to migrate. This layer contains all the logic that is required to translate the requests from modern systems. The biggest challenge in introducing this layer is, it will add one more hop for the user and adds to latency. A decision must be taken between speed vs. data.</li>

<li><strong>Circuit Breaker Pattern:</strong> When you travel in flight, there is an oxygen mask and a life west, which is rarely paid attention to other than the air hostess who demonstrates passionately. The reason is very evident. These are used only when there is a failure. Your basic assumption is your flight will not fail, it is not required for you to use and so you will not pay attention. But this is not true for IT systems.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everything fails all the time” — Werner Vogels, AWS CTO</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am sure you heard about many famous websites being <a href="https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/">down</a> because of various reasons. In a distributed environment anything can fail at any time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an architect, you can’t prevent failures. You can only design to handle the failures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Circuit breaker pattern prevents an application from performing an operation that is almost certain to fail. Let me explain this. Your system is suddenly experiencing load and there are more API requests than it can handle. For instance, service typical response time threshold is 5 second and now requests are taking more than that and your service starts sending 500 responses back. Keeping aside the bad experience to the user, your system might completely give up if there is more load beyond a certain point. Now it is time to stop more requests.</p>
<p>Let's compare this with how an electrical circuit breaker works. Did you ever encounter this? You just switched on a plug and your electricity is suddenly gone. Now you may need to go to your switchboard either in the basement or in your main hall and ON the switch that went off. This is where the circuit breaker is in action in the real world. What is this doing? As the load is high, the electricity was stopped to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>Lets now come back to our world. The circuit breaker pattern has three states. Closed, Open and Half Opened. In the closed state, everything is normal and your system works as it is intended. When there is an issue, the circuit breaker opens and data flow cuts off. This means that intended requested are not served to users. Half Open tries to test the waters after some wait time, to see if the problem still exists. If it is successful, state gets changed to closed so that system comes back to normal. If it is not successful, it will go back to open state.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Event Sourcing</strong>: This pattern became popular in recent days as data became new oil. This pattern suggests that, do not just store the state of an action but an entire history. Let’s say you are building a banking application. A customer will have multiple debits and credits in a period of time. Let's say the customer starts with $1000. On Day 1, she credits $50, on Day 2, she debits $100, on Day 3 she credits $150. At the end of day3, she will have $1100. However, in the case of Event Sourcing, you store all the transactions without losing a single action. When you have this data you can use for multiple purposes. While you can definitely tell what is her bank balance at any point of time by doing a quick calculation on the fly, you can also understand her banking patterns which otherwise not possible.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-35.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Event Sourcing</p>
<p>Let's look at one more example. You are building a movie ticket booking system. For a popular movie, you will see a lot of rush from the audience, which will cause scalability issues. Customer may book, cancel or hold the seats. Let's say the theatre has 200 seats. You need to constantly calculate available seats to make the number visible to the next customer. This is where event sourcing will be handy. Instead of calculating the available seats as a CRUD operation, you will go through all the events and finally arrive to a number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scalability, Resiliency, Fault Tolerance and Performance</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5. Publisher-Subscriber pattern</strong></p>
<p>This is popularly called as Pub/Sub pattern. In a cloud based system, modules of one system need to communicate with modules of same or another system asynchronously. Let me give an example. You are building a leave management system. Whenever an employee applies for a leave, you need to inform, Timesheet module, Scheduling module and Payroll module at the same time. This can be done with an async call. These modules just consume data. They will not validate the data. However, when an employee applies for leave, balance verification must be a sync call (typically a REST Api call), as an employee must not apply for leave when there are no balances (well, goes with HR policies of the organization)</p>
<p>One more example here. Imagine that you are a news sourcing company and you gather the news from various input mechanisms. Your end-users are newspapers and publishing companies. Then you capture the news on the ground and publish to your customers. If your customer is a sports magazine, they will only consume sports-related news or if your customer is a finance website, they will only use finance related to data. Your responsibility is to capture what is happening in the world without losing a single event. It is up to the customers to decide what they want to consume. You can also create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20materialized%20view,summary%20using%20an%20aggregate%20function.">materialized views</a> for further consumption.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-36.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Pub Sub Pattern</p>
<p>Message brokers as mentioned in the picture best used for asynchronous communication. Whenever there is a need for resilient and fault-tolerant applications, Pub-Sub pattern comes handy. There are plenty of options for Message broker, <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>, <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/">Apache Active MQ</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">AWS Kinesis</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/in-en/products/mq">IBM MQ</a>. Apache Kafka is most popular, known for high performance and zero loss of data.</p>

<p><strong>6. Sharding Pattern:</strong> If you invest in stock market, it is a well-proven strategy that you will not put all your money in one single stock. You will create a portfolio of stocks and invest. With this approach, if one stock price goes down you still will have other stocks making some profits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't put all your eggs in a single basket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharding takes a similar approach. In this pattern, you will divide data into multiple partitions or shards. This massively improves the scalability. This pattern comes under horizontal scalability, not vertical scalability. What will happen if the data is stored in a single data store? Same as single stock in the above example. If the datastore goes down, your users will not be able to access the data causing lot of pain. Beyond a certain point, you will encounter storage issues, computing power, network and bandwidth issues. If you are servicing users in different locations, having one data store will add to latency issues.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-37.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Sharding improves the scalability, performance and fault tolerance. There are multiple ways to come up with sharding strategy. The strategy goes with your use case.</p>
<p><strong>Range-based Sharding:</strong> Suppose if you are storing customer data, you may look at storing based in pin code or zip code range. The disadvantage with this model is your customer data may not be equally distributed</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Sharding:</strong> If you are building an e-commerce application, you might store customer demographic details in one shard and customer buying transactions in another shard. This gives an opportunity for you to scale as you needed.</p>
<p><strong>Hash-based Sharding:</strong> This is a widely used strategy. If you have 5 shards to store customer data. You take for example customer unique id and apply modulo 5.</p>
<p>Some fun maths for you now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to calculate Modulo 5 of any number. It is simple. Let’s say the number is 23. Divide this number by 5. You will get 4.6. Now take 4 and multiply by 5. You get 20. Now do 23–20, you will get 3. Thus, the answer to “What is 23 mod 5?” is <strong>3</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hash-based sharding will have challenges in long run. What if you would like to add one more shard after an year. You need to change the sharding logic and the capacity in the data store goes for a toss. The solution is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing">consistent hashing</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Data Management</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>7. Strangler Pattern:</strong> Wikipedia meaning of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/strangler">Strangler</a> is an epiphyte whose aerial roots eventually strangle the tree on which it grows. Today pretty much every organization is moving from monolithic to micros services. This journey is not going to be easy in any means. When you migrate to a new system from a legacy system, you systematically move the functionality to the new system instead of a big bang approach. If you are migrating a legacy monolithic application to cloud microservices application, this pattern comes handy. Eventually, when the migration is over, the user directly interacts with modern applications. In this pattern, the small functionalities (or micro services) that are built and getting migrated, eventually kills the main system. Find more details on this pattern from <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html">Martin Fowler’s</a> blog.</p>

<p><strong>8. Saga Pattern:</strong> This is the best pattern to manage data consistency in a distributed system. Before the internet and WhatsApp, people used to travel to relatives and friends home personally and give marriage invitations. This is seen as inviting with respect. Anyways, keeping this aside, what if the marriage cancels by any chance? You do not want your relatives and friends to come on that day. The best way is you again travel to each person’s place and tell them that marriage got cancelled. (Not a positive example. But that's life). This is exactly Saga pattern. The first paper on Saga pattern was published in <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/cs711/2002fa/reading/sagas.pdf">1987</a>.</p>
<p>There are two ways to implement sagas pattern. Event/Choreography design and Command/Orchestration Sequencing Logic. Choreography design is very complicated. Lets look at Command/Orchestration Sequencing Logic. I will now take the example of flight booking application. This is the sequence when you book a flight.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a seat (Seat Service)</li>
<li>Select Meal (Meal Service)</li>
<li>Pay for booking (Payment Service)</li>
<li>Available seats now get updated to deduct one seat (Booking Service)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-39.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Saga Orchestrator</p>
<p>Let's look at the sequence of events:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Booking Service</em> saves a available seat for user and asks Booking Saga Orchestrator (BSO) to start a Book seat transaction.</li>
<li><em>BSO</em> sends a “<em><strong>Do Payment”</strong></em> command to <em>Payment Service</em>, and it replies with a <em><strong>Payment Succesful</strong></em> message</li>
<li><em>BSO</em> sends a <em><strong>Confirm a seat</strong></em> command to Seat Service, and it replies with a <em><strong>Seat Confirmed</strong></em> message</li>
<li><em>BSO</em> sends a <em><strong>Book a meal</strong></em> command to Meal Service, and it replies with a <em><strong>Meal Confirmed</strong></em> message.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's say payment service fails. You do not want to offer a free seat and a free meal for your customer. Now BSO sends a command to roll back the seat booking and meal booking. A very good and detailed explanation of Saga Pattern can be found <a href="https://blog.couchbase.com/saga-pattern-implement-business-transactions-using-microservices-part/">here</a></p>

<p><strong>9. Throttling Pattern:</strong> If you ever visited any famous <a href="https://www.tirumala.org/">Indian temples</a> on a good day, there will be 50K to 100K devotees. The Darshan time (time in front of God) lasts for just few seconds but they spend in the queue anywhere between 4 to 8 hours. Temple administration usually controls the crowd by putting them in small compartments with some seating facility. Lets says there are 20 compartments and one final queue before “darshan”. Around 200 people will fit in one compartment. As the time progresses, people move from compartment 1 to compartment 2 and so on until they hit the final queue. This is called Throttling.</p>
<p>When it comes to IT applications, most of the times load is predictable until unless there are some black swan events. E-commerce site gets more load during festive season or when there is a sale. For a banking system there may be more load during the time when the salary is getting credited. For a time capturing system, there will be peak load during morning, afternoon and evening time. One option to handle these peak loads is to auto scale the resources. Second option is to put a limit on the number of transaction that the system can process and start throttling the remaining transactions. With this, the SLAs are met and system continues to function as it is intended.</p>

<p><strong>10. Static content hosting pattern:</strong> On a typical website, the content that doesn't change is called static content. It is generally created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Javascript is not mandatory, can also be done with just HTML and CSS(or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)">Sass</a>). The dynamic website will have a logic to run on the web server and usually does CRUD operations on data which is not possible to be served by the static website. Dynamic websites depend on server-side processing, including server-side scripts such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET or Node.js. For example, you would like to know the price of a product before buying, you would like to pay your electricity bill, you want to post happy birthday on your friend’s timeline, or even complicated, you would like to implement your options strategy of a stock. All these require a dynamic website. With the emergence of AWS, Azure and Google cloud platform static hosting doesn’t need your own server to run. For example, you can host your static website on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> (Simple Storage Service) without a need to spin off a new server. in addition, you can speed up your site by using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Cloudfront</a> which will store the files at the edge location close to users.</p>

<p>A brief introduction to Microservice, SOA, Event-Driven, MicroKernel, Stream-Based, and more.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-software-architecture-1"><a class="header" href="#what-is-software-architecture-1">What is Software Architecture?</a></h1>
<p><em><strong>Software architecture</strong></em> is the process of defining the high-level structure and organization of a software system. It involves identifying and selecting the right components, deciding how they should interact with each other, and determining how they should be organized to achieve specific goals. The goal of software architecture is to create a system that is maintainable, scalable, and secure, and that can meet the needs of users and organizations over time.</p>
<h1 id="why-do-we-need-software-architecture-1"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-software-architecture-1">Why do we need Software Architecture?</a></h1>
<p>A robust architecture provides a solid foundation for building software that meets the needs of users and stakeholders. It ensures that the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, and reliability. With a well-designed architecture, developers can build software that is easy to modify and extend, making it easier to adapt to changing business needs.</p>
<p>Software architecture is also essential for managing complexity. As software systems become more complex, it becomes challenging to understand how different components interact with each other. A well-designed architecture provides a high-level view of the system, making it easier to understand its structure and operation. This, in turn, helps developers to identify potential issues and make informed decisions about how to modify the system.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-we-document-architecture-we-use-4c-model-1"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-document-architecture-we-use-4c-model-1"><strong>How do we Document Architecture? We use 4C Model.</strong></a></h1>
<h2 id="context-level-1"><a class="header" href="#context-level-1">Context Level</a></h2>
<p>At the highest level, the Context level, we describe the system’s external environment, such as users, other systems, regulations, etc. This level provides a high-level overview of the system’s purpose and its relationship to the external world. It helps to identify the stakeholders who will interact with the system and the factors that will influence its design and development.</p>
<h2 id="containers-level-1"><a class="header" href="#containers-level-1">Containers level</a></h2>
<p>The next level is the Containers level, which describes the runtime environment of the system, such as servers, databases, or message queues. This level helps to identify the major technology choices and deployment decisions. It provides an understanding of the physical infrastructure that will support the system and the tools and resources that will be required to deploy and maintain it.</p>
<h2 id="components-level-1"><a class="header" href="#components-level-1">Components level</a></h2>
<p>The third level is the Components level, which describes the major functional building blocks of the system. This level helps to identify the modules, classes, or functions that make up the system. It provides an understanding of the system’s functionality and the relationships between its different components.</p>
<h2 id="code-level-1"><a class="header" href="#code-level-1">Code level</a></h2>
<p>Finally, the Code level is the lowest level, which describes the actual code and how it implements the components. This level provides a detailed understanding of how the system works and how its different components interact with each other. It is essential for developers who will be working with the code to have a clear understanding of how it is structured and how it works.</p>
<p>Using the C4 model, software architects can create diagrams and written documentation that describe each of these levels, providing a comprehensive view of the system’s architecture. This approach helps to identify potential issues and trade-offs, as well as facilitating scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. By documenting the architecture in this way, developers and stakeholders can have a clear and easy-to-understand view of the system, making it easier to modify and extend as business needs change.</p>

<h2 id="1-client-server-1"><a class="header" href="#1-client-server-1">1. Client Server</a></h2>
<p>The client-server architecture is a model in which the client, a user or an application, sends a request to the server, which in turn responds with the requested data or service. The client and server can be on the same machine or on different machines connected through a network.</p>
<p>The client is responsible for initiating communication with the server and sending a request. The server, on the other hand, listens for incoming requests from clients, processes them, and returns a response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Advantages of Client-Server Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Scalability:</strong></em> Client-server architecture is highly scalable, as it allows multiple clients to connect to the same server and share resources.</p>
<p><em><strong>Security:</strong></em> Client-server architecture provides better security than other network models, as the server can control access to resources and data.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reliability:</strong></em> Client-server architecture is highly reliable, as the server can provide backup and recovery services in case of failures.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="2-layering-1"><a class="header" href="#2-layering-1">2. Layering</a></h2>
<p>It’s a common way to design complex software systems, and it involves breaking down the system into layers, where each layer is responsible for a specific set of functions. This approach helps to organize code and makes it easier to maintain and modify the system over time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>A typical layering architecture consists of three main layers: presentation, business logic, and data access.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> The presentation layer is responsible for displaying information to the user and gathering input. This layer includes the user interface and any other components that interact directly with the user. The user interface is what the user sees and interacts with, such as buttons, text boxes, and menus. The presentation layer also includes any logic related to the user interface, such as event handlers and validation.</p>
<p><strong>Business Logic Layer:</strong> The business logic layer is responsible for implementing the business rules of the application. This layer contains the code that processes and manipulates data, as well as any other application logic. The business logic layer is where the magic happens, so to speak. It’s where the software performs calculations, makes decisions, and carries out tasks. This layer is where the software really earns its keep.</p>
<p><strong>Data Access Layer:</strong> The data access layer is responsible for interacting with the database or other external data sources. This layer contains the code that reads and writes data to and from the database. The data access layer is where the software retrieves data from the database, makes changes to the data, and saves the changes back to the database. This layer is critical to the functioning of the software, as it enables the software to store and retrieve data.</p>

<h2 id="3-pipe-and-filter-1"><a class="header" href="#3-pipe-and-filter-1">3. Pipe and Filter</a></h2>
<p>Pipe and Filter Architecture is a design pattern that allows software systems to process data by separating the processing tasks into multiple independent components. This architecture is particularly useful for systems that need to handle large amounts of data, as it can help to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability.</p>
<p>The Pipe and Filter Architecture is based on the idea of a pipeline, where data flows through a series of processing steps, each of which performs a specific task. Each processing step is implemented as a separate component, or filter, that accepts data as input, performs some operation on the data, and produces output data. The output data is then passed on to the next filter in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The filters in the pipeline are independent of each other, which means that they can be developed, tested, and deployed separately. This makes it easy to add new filters to the pipeline or modify existing ones without affecting the rest of the system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Benefits</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Scalability:</strong> The architecture can be scaled horizontally by adding more filters to the pipeline, which allows the system to handle larger amounts of data.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> The architecture can be optimized for performance by parallelizing the processing of data across multiple filters.</p>
<p><strong>Maintainability:</strong> The architecture promotes modularity and separation of concerns, which makes it easier to maintain and update the system over time.</p>

<h2 id="4-master-slave-1"><a class="header" href="#4-master-slave-1">4. Master-Slave</a></h2>
<p>Master-Slave architecture is a design pattern used in distributed systems, where one node (the master) controls one or more nodes (the slaves) to perform specific tasks. The master node is responsible for distributing the workload across the slaves and for coordinating their activities. The slave nodes do not have the same level of control as the master node and only perform tasks that are assigned to them by the master.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Benefits</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the most significant advantages is that it allows for the efficient distribution of workload across multiple nodes. This helps to reduce the load on any one node and ensures that the system can handle large amounts of data and traffic.</p>
<p>Another advantage of using a master-slave architecture is that it provides fault tolerance. If one of the slave nodes fails, the master node can redistribute its workload to the other slave nodes. This ensures that the system can continue to function even if one or more nodes fail.</p>

<h2 id="5-microkernel-1"><a class="header" href="#5-microkernel-1">5. MicroKernel</a></h2>
<p>MicroKernel architecture is a software design pattern that allows developers to build more modular and flexible systems. It separates the core system functionality from additional features, which are implemented in separate modules. The core functionality of the system is implemented in the MicroKernel, a minimalistic core system that provides only the most essential services required to run the system. It is plug and play concept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s consider the example of an e-commerce website. The MicroKernel would provide essential services such as handling user authentication, managing user sessions, and processing payments. Additional features, such as product recommendations, user reviews, and social media integration, would be implemented in separate modules.</p>
<p>If the website wants to add a new feature, such as a loyalty program, it can be developed and added as a separate module without affecting the core functionality of the system. This modularity makes it easier to add new features or remove existing ones without affecting the core system functionality.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the website wants to customize its system to meet the specific needs of different users, it can choose the modules it needs for each user. For example, a user who frequently buys electronics can be provided with a module that recommends electronic products. On the other hand, a user who frequently buys cosmetics can be provided with a module that recommends cosmetic products.</p>
<p>Finally, if the website wants to scale its system to handle more users or changes in hardware, it can easily add or remove modules as needed. This scalability makes it easier to adapt the system to changes in user requirements or changes in the underlying hardware.</p>

<h2 id="6-ddd-domain-driven-design-1"><a class="header" href="#6-ddd-domain-driven-design-1">6. DDD (Domain Driven Design)</a></h2>
<p>At its core, DDD is a way of thinking about software architecture that emphasizes the domain or problem space of a project. This means that developers focus on the business logic of the software, rather than just the technical implementation.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that developers start by understanding the domain they are working in and break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. They then use this understanding to create a domain model, which is a representation of the different entities within the domain and how they interact with one another.</p>
<p>Once the domain model is created, developers can use it to guide the rest of the architecture of the software. This includes creating bounded contexts, which are areas of the software that are defined by a specific language and context, and aggregates, which are collections of related entities that are treated as a single unit.</p>
<h2 id="7-component-based-1"><a class="header" href="#7-component-based-1">7. Component Based</a></h2>
<p>In software engineering, component-based architecture (CBA) is an approach to software design and development that emphasizes the use of reusable software components. The idea behind CBA is that software development can be made more efficient and effective by breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is a component?</strong></p>
<p>A software component is a modular, self-contained unit of software that can be reused across different systems. A component typically has a well-defined interface, which specifies how other components can interact with it. This interface includes information about the component’s inputs, outputs, and behavior.</p>
<p>Components can be classified into different types based on their functionality, such as user interface components, data access components, and business logic components. Each type of component has a specific role in the software system and can interact with other components through their interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="8-soa-1"><a class="header" href="#8-soa-1">8. SOA</a></h2>
<p>SOA is an architectural style that aims to create modular, reusable services that can be easily integrated with other services to create a larger system. In this approach, services expose their functionality through interfaces, which can be accessed by other services or applications.</p>
<p>At its core, SOA is about building software by breaking it down into smaller pieces, or modules, that can be reused across different applications. This modular approach allows developers to focus on building specific pieces of functionality and then integrating them with other pieces to create a larger system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Core Components of SOA</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Service Provider:</strong> The service provider is responsible for creating and exposing services to the outside world. These services can be used by other services, applications, or end-users. For example, a payment processing service provider might create and expose a service that allows other applications to process payments.</p>
<p><strong>Service Registry:</strong> The service registry is a directory of available services that can be accessed by other services or applications. The service registry provides information about the service, such as its name, location, and interface. For example, if an application needs to process payments, it can use the service registry to find the payment processing service and access its interface.</p>
<p><strong>Service Requestor:</strong> The service requestor is responsible for consuming the services exposed by the service provider. This can be done by using the service registry to find the appropriate service and then invoking its interface. For example, an application might use the service registry to find the payment processing service and then use its interface to process payments.</p>

<h2 id="9-monolithic-1"><a class="header" href="#9-monolithic-1">9. Monolithic</a></h2>
<p>Monolithic architecture is a software design pattern that has been around for decades. It’s a way of structuring an application as a single, cohesive unit, rather than splitting it up into individual, smaller components.</p>
<p>In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. All of the code and dependencies are packaged together, so the application can be deployed and run on a single server.</p>
<p>This makes it easy to develop and deploy the application, since everything is in one place. It also makes it easier to scale the application horizontally, by adding more servers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Advantages of Monolithic Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of monolithic architecture is its simplicity. Since everything is contained in a single unit, there are fewer moving parts to worry about. This makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy the application.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that it’s easier to maintain and debug a monolithic application. Since everything is in one place, it’s easier to track down issues and fix them.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the biggest disadvantages of monolithic architecture is that it can be difficult to scale the application vertically. Since everything is running on a single server, there’s a limit to how much traffic the application can handle.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that it can be difficult to adopt new technologies and languages in a monolithic application. Since everything is packaged together, it can be hard to update individual components without breaking the entire application.</p>

<h2 id="10-microservice-1"><a class="header" href="#10-microservice-1">10. Microservice</a></h2>
<p>Microservice architecture is a style of software architecture that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Each service is focused on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of other services in the system.</p>
<p>The main idea behind microservice architecture is to break down a large, monolithic application into smaller, more manageable services. This approach brings several benefits, such as improved scalability, increased flexibility, and quicker time-to-market for new features. With a microservice architecture, each service can be scaled independently, making it easier to handle traffic spikes or changes in demand. Developers can also modify or add new services without affecting other parts of the system, which speeds up the development process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Challenges of Microservice Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p>Despite the benefits of microservice architecture, it also introduces additional complexity. One of the biggest challenges is managing inter-service communication. Services need to be able to discover each other and communicate effectively, which can be difficult to do at scale. Load balancing and fault tolerance are also more complex in a microservice architecture.</p>
<p>Another challenge is ensuring that each service has its own data store. In a monolithic application, all data is typically stored in a single database. With microservices, each service should have its own data store to ensure that changes to one service do not affect other services in the system. This can lead to increased complexity in data management and synchronization.</p>
<p><em><strong>Best Practices for Microservice Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p>To ensure the success of a microservice-based system, developers should follow best practices for designing and implementing microservices. Some of these best practices include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Design services that are loosely coupled and highly cohesive, with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use containerization technology, such as Docker, to package and deploy each service as a separate container. This allows for easy scaling and deployment of individual services as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement effective monitoring and management tools to ensure that the system is running smoothly and to detect and address issues quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a service mesh, such as Istio, to manage inter-service communication and load balancing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the testing and deployment of microservices.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="11-event-driven-1"><a class="header" href="#11-event-driven-1">11. Event Driven</a></h2>
<p>Event Driven Architecture (EDA) is an approach to designing software systems that enables rapid and efficient communication between different components or services. In this paradigm, different software components communicate with each other using events, rather than through direct requests or responses.</p>
<p>In EDA, events are generated by different components of a software system, such as a user interface or a backend service. These events are then broadcast to other components of the system, which can subscribe to them and act on them as needed.</p>
<p>For example, consider a simple e-commerce application. When a new order is placed, the order processing service can generate an “order created” event, which is then broadcast to other services such as inventory management, shipping, and billing. Each of these services can then process the event and make updates to their respective systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Benefits of EDA</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the key benefits of EDA is its ability to decouple different components of a software system. When different components communicate through events rather than direct requests, they become less dependent on each other. This makes it easier to change or update individual components of the system without affecting the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Another benefit of EDA is its scalability. Because events are broadcast to multiple components of the system, it is possible to process large volumes of data and transactions in parallel. This makes it easier to handle high traffic and spikes in demand.</p>
<p><em><strong>Challenges of EDA</strong></em></p>
<p>While EDA has many benefits, it also has some challenges. One of the main challenges is managing the complexity of event-driven systems. Because events can be generated and consumed by many different components, it can be difficult to track and debug issues that arise.</p>
<p>Another challenge is ensuring that events are processed in the correct order. Because events can be generated and processed asynchronously, it is possible for events to be processed out of order. This can cause issues such as data inconsistencies or incorrect calculations.</p>

<h2 id="12-stream-based-1"><a class="header" href="#12-stream-based-1">12. Stream Based</a></h2>
<p>As software development becomes more complex and demands greater scalability, traditional architectures are becoming less and less effective. Stream-based architecture is emerging as a promising alternative that enables developers to build systems that can handle massive amounts of data in real-time.</p>
<p>At its core, stream-based architecture is based on the principles of event-driven programming. Instead of processing data in batches, stream-based systems process data as it is generated in real-time. This allows developers to build systems that can respond to changes in data with minimal latency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Benefit of Stream-Based Architecture</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the key benefits of stream-based architecture is its scalability. Because data is processed in real-time, stream-based systems can handle massive amounts of data without the need for complex batch processing pipelines. This makes it possible to build systems that can process millions of events per second, making it ideal for use cases like sensor data processing, financial trading, and online advertising.</p>
<p>Another benefit of stream-based architecture is its flexibility. Because data is processed in real-time, it is possible to build systems that can respond to changes in data with minimal latency. This makes it possible to build complex, event-driven systems that can adapt to changing business requirements. For example, in an e-commerce platform, stream-based architecture can be used to track user activity in real-time and respond with personalized recommendations and promotions based on the user’s browsing and purchasing history.</p>
<p>Furthermore, stream-based architecture can provide significant cost savings. Traditional batch processing pipelines require expensive hardware and complex software infrastructure to manage the data processing. On the other hand, stream-based systems can be built on inexpensive commodity hardware, making it much easier to scale and maintain.</p>
<p>Finally, stream-based architecture is highly fault-tolerant. Because data is processed in real-time, it is possible to build systems that can automatically recover from failures without the need for manual intervention. This makes it possible to build systems that can operate at scale with high levels of reliability, reducing the risk of data loss or system downtime.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="23-fundamental-principles-in-software-architecture"><a class="header" href="#23-fundamental-principles-in-software-architecture">23 Fundamental Principles in Software Architecture</a></h1>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-53.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Software Architecture bases on set of basic principles that is actual for every kind of software system. Experienced Software Architects are aware of them and able to spot the right places in their software products to implement specific principle. Let us have a quick overview over some basic principles that Software Architects deals with on daily basis:</p>
<p><em><strong>1.Dependency Inversion…</strong></em> This principle states that direction of dependency should be towards abstraction not implementation. If compile-time dependency flows in direction of run-time execution this makes directed dependency. With Dependency Inversion we invert the direction of dependency control.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.Separation of Concerns…</strong></em> This principle states that a software system should be separated by the kind of work it does. For Example: It is noteworthy to separate the software system into different pieces by business logic, infrastructure or user interface. By splitting the system into different parts based on different activity areas makes it easier to develop/test/deploy. SoC is a driving force behind Software Architecture Patterns like Domain Driven Design, Hexagonal Architecture, Clean Architecture.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.Inversion of Control…</strong></em></p>
<p>This principle is similar to Dependency Inversion Principle but in broader context. IoC inverts the flow of control which is managed by different third party frameworks such as Spring Framework. Unlike traditional Java EE programs where Beans are initialized procedurally by the engineer that developed it, Spring takes control of Configuration Beans, which means inverting the control.</p>
<p><em><strong>4.Dependency Injection…</strong></em></p>
<p>This Principle states that for example in java terms: dependency should be injected through constructor in run-time. Action Interface is injected in Human class through its HumanAction Implementation, that decides in run-time which specific action to implement. This technique gives some flexibility of dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package az.alizeynalli.di;

public interface Action {
    void do();
}

public class HumanAction implements Action {
 
    @Override
    public void do() {
        System.out.print(&quot;run&quot;);
    }
}

public class Human  {
     
    Action action;
     
    public Human(Action action) {
        this.action = action;
    }
 
    @Override
    public void do() {        
        actoin.do();        
    }
}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Human human = new Human(new HumanAction);
        human.do();
    }
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>5.Single Responsibility…</strong></em></p>
<p>This principle’s main idea is to limit each building block of a software system by one and only responsibility. No matter what is the scope of a building block, be it plugin, package, class, function even a variable. Each of these building blocks should have only one responsibility. </p>
<p><em><strong>6.Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)…</strong></em></p>
<p>This principle aims to eliminate redundancy in code by avoiding duplicate code. If there is existing functionality for some behaviour this should be repeatedly used, instead of having same code snippet in multiple instances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>7.Open-Closed…</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This simple description of the principle was firstly introduced by Bertrand Meyer. Software system that needs modification each time for any additional functionality is just a big mess. On the other hand, this kind of chaotic program is welcoming occasional bugs every time modification is made. Preferably, every new functionality should be maximum of new code and minimum of change in old code, in ideal world: zero changes in old code.</p>
<p><em><strong>8.Persistence Ignorance…</strong></em></p>
<p>PI bases on the idea that code should be unaffected by whichever database or persistence technology is chosen. Business Logic should be free of any technology chosen to be applied. If tomorrow, there is better alternative persistence technology which is more effective and for better price, changing this part of software system should not affect upper abstraction layers.</p>
<p><em><strong>9.YAGNI…</strong></em></p>
<p>You ain’t gonna need it. This principle tries to avoid premature optimization of a software system. Often developers overengineer some things in a software system with the vision that some time in future it will be helpful. But this time often never comes.</p>
<p><em><strong>10.Boy Scout Rule…</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main idea here is to always keep refactoring code as you encounter anti-patterns while developing further. This leads to better code quality over time.</p>
<p><em><strong>11.Liskov-Subsititution…</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behaviour of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition from Barbara Liskov might sound pretty confusing but in essence, it is a simple and easy to understand principle. If we restate the above given definition, the principle’s motto is: when using inheritance, hierarchy of inheritance should be from functional and business logic aspect consistent. The subtypes should be mutually substitutable and not alter behavior of parent class. As a simple example we can take <em>“infamous square/rectangle”</em> problem. Where square should not be subtype of rectangle, because definition of height and length of these two geometric forms are different (square’s height and weight are equal whereas for rectangle they will vary).</p>
<p><em><strong>12.Encapsulation…</strong></em></p>
<p>Different building blocks of a Software System should make use of Encapsulation by restricting access to its components from outside world. This achieved by setting components private in a class scope or setting access restrictions in plugin scope (in terms of java) so hiding information.</p>
<p><em><strong>13.Loose Coupling…</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the most important principles in Software Architecture is Loose Coupling which means simply put loose dependencies. This principle states that software systems should be loosely dependent on each other. If one part of software systems changes, this should influence other parts minimally. Loose Coupling is possible through Dependency Inversion, Asynchronous Messaging Middleware, Event Sourcing etc. </p>
<p><em><strong>14. Cohesion…</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together. In one sense, it is a measure of the strength of relationship between the methods and data of a class and some unifying purpose or concept served by that class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a best practice to have highly cohesive classes, which motivates single responsibility principle, loose coupling etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>15. Interface Segregation…</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Interface-Segregation Principle</strong></em> <em>states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should make it clear that, this principle is applicable mostly to statically-typed programming languages like Java, C etc. In dynamically typed languages like Python or Ruby this principle does not make a big sense.</p>
<p>We can imagine a situation that our Income and Expense Use Cases are dependent on a functionality that holds business logic for both cases. So Income Use Case has an abundant dependency on a functionality that is used for Expense Use Case and Expense Use Case has the same issue in respect to Income Use Case. Following is the Violation of ISP based on above discussion:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package az.alizeynalli.cashflow.core.service;

public interface ConverterService {
    Income convertIncome(Income income);
    Expense convertExpense(Expense expense);
}

@Component
public class ExpenseConverterServiceImpl implements ConverterService {

    @Override
    public Income convertIncome(Income income) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }

    @Override
    public Expense convertExpense(Expense expense) {
        // convert expense here
        return expense;
    }
}

@Component
public class IncomeConverterServiceImpl implements ConverterService {

    @Override
    public Income convertIncome(Income income) {
        // convert income here
        return income;
    }

    @Override
    public Expense convertExpense(Expense expense) {
        
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>16. Bounded Context…</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bounded contexts are a central pattern in Domain-Driven Design. They provide a way of tackling complexity in large applications or organizations by breaking it up into separate conceptual modules. Each conceptual module then represents a context that is separated from other contexts (hence, bounded), and can evolve independently. Each bounded context should ideally be free to choose its own names for concepts within it, and should have exclusive access to its own persistence store. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>17.Stable Dependencies…</strong></em></p>
<p>This principle states that different building blocks of a software system should only depend on artifacts that reliable, stable. This principle makes more sense in docker image terms, where you import different dependencies from docker hub without even knowing how reliable/stable are they.</p>
<p><em><strong>18. Polymorphism…</strong></em></p>
<p>This actually belongs to 4 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming and motivates usage of interfaces (in java terms!) which can be provisioned in multiple forms. Polymorphism means: entity with multiple forms.</p>
<p><em><strong>19. Modularization…</strong></em></p>
<p>Modularization is the process of dividing a software system into multiple independent modules where each module works independently. This principle is another form of single responsibility separation of concerns principles applied to the static structure of a software system.</p>
<p><em><strong>20. Abstraction…</strong></em></p>
<p>This also belongs to 4 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming and states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details or attributes in the study of objects or systems to focus attention on details of greater importance; it is similar in nature to the process of generalization;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>21. Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)…</strong></em></p>
<p>As it is understandable from the above statement this principle motivates software engineers to keep the code simple and stupid(understandable) to avoid potential future misunderstandings from other peer engineers.</p>
<p><em><strong>22. Incremental/Iterative Approach…</strong></em></p>
<p>This principle is basics of Agile Software Development Manifesto, that bases on the idea that software system should be developed on incremental and iterative manner. That means with every iteration software system is incremented and gone live.</p>
<p><em><strong>23. Least Knowledge…</strong></em></p>
<p>Or information envying is another term to encapsulation or information hiding principles which states that different parts of software system should only have knowledge that they need.</p>

<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-52.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>If you landed on this blog, I believe you know what modern architecture design patterns are. But for some of our less experienced friends here, think of architecture design patterns as the way you design your application(s) such that they scale and don’t need your resignation for that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Architecture Design Patterns, in a nutshell, are design patterns for High Level Design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern problems demand modern solutions. For applications to cater to enterprises or even an internet-level audience, they need to be scalable, available, secure, and resilient. Without a doubt, all major league companies are looking for developers who can grasp and solve these difficulties.</p>
<p>The question now is: how do developers solve these problems? One way is to follow good architectural design patterns. Here I present you 7 deadly Sins:-</p>
<h1 id="circuit-breaker-pattern"><a class="header" href="#circuit-breaker-pattern">Circuit Breaker Pattern</a></h1>
<p>Michael Nygard’s book, <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/mnee2/">Release It!</a>, popularized the Circuit Breaker pattern, which can prevent an application from continually attempting to execute an action that is likely to fail, allowing it to proceed without waiting for the problem to be corrected or spending CPU cycles while determining the fault’s duration.</p>
<p>The Circuit Breaker pattern also allows an application to determine whether or not the issue has been remedied. If the problem appears to be resolved, the program can attempt to perform the operation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Circuit Breaker pattern serves a distinct purpose than the Retry pattern. The Retry pattern allows an application to retry an operation in the hope that it will succeed the next time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Circuit Breaker design prohibits an application from doing a risky activity. An application can use the Retry pattern to trigger an action through a circuit breaker to combine these two patterns. The retry logic, on the other hand, should be alert to any exceptions supplied by the circuit breaker and should cease repeat attempts if the circuit breaker indicates that a fault is not temporary.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-51.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h1 id="event-sourcing-pattern"><a class="header" href="#event-sourcing-pattern">Event Sourcing Pattern</a></h1>
<p>Most apps operate with data, and the common method is for the program to keep the data in its present state by updating it when users interact with it. In the classic create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) architecture, for example, a typical data operation is to receive data from the store, make some changes to it, and then update the current state of the data with the new values— often by utilizing transactions that lock the data.</p>
<p>The Event Sourcing design defines a method for handling data activities that are triggered by a series of events, each of which is recorded in an append-only store. Application code delivers a series of events to the event store, where they are persisted, that must describe each action that has occurred on the data. Each event describes a collection of data changes (for example, <em>&quot;AddedItemToOrder&quot;</em>).</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-50.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>The events are saved in an event store, which serves as the system of record (the official data source) for the data’s present state. These events are often published by the event retailer so that consumers are aware and can handle them if necessary. Consumers may, for example, start tasks that apply the operations in the events to other systems, or they could execute any other associated action required to finish the process. It’s worth noting that the application code that generates the events is separate from the systems that subscribe to them.</p>
<h1 id="sidecar-pattern"><a class="header" href="#sidecar-pattern">SideCar Pattern</a></h1>
<p>Monitoring, logging, configuration, and networking services are frequently required by applications and services. These extraneous chores might be carried out as distinct components or services.</p>
<p>A sidecar service is not always part of the application, but it is linked to it. It follows the parent application everywhere it goes. Sidecars are procedures or services that are delivered alongside the principal application. The sidecar on a motorbike is coupled to one motorcycle, and each motorcycle can have its own sidecar. A sidecar service, similarly, mirrors the fate of its parent application. A sidecar instance is deployed and hosted alongside each instance of the application.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-49.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>They can execute in the same process as the application if they are tightly integrated, making optimal use of shared resources. This, however, implies that they are not properly separated, and a failure in one of these components can affect other components or the entire application. Furthermore, they must normally be written in the same language as the parent program. As a result, the component and the application are highly dependent on one another.</p>
<h1 id="cqrs"><a class="header" href="#cqrs">CQRS</a></h1>
<p>CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that isolates data store read and update processes. CQRS implementation in your application can improve its performance, scalability, and security. The flexibility gained by moving to CQRS enables a system to evolve more effectively over time and prevents update instructions from triggering merge conflicts at the domain level.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-48.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Separate query and update models make design and implementation easier. although, CQRS code cannot be automatically generated from a database schema using scaffolding techniques such as O/RM tools (although, you can add your customised on top of the generated code).</p>
<p>You can physically split the read and write data for more isolation. In that instance, the read database can utilise its own query-optimized data schema. It can, for example, store a materialised view of the data to avoid complex joins or O/RM mappings. It may even employ a different sort of data storage. For example, the write database could be relational, and the read database could be a document database.</p>
<h1 id="rate-limiting-pattern"><a class="header" href="#rate-limiting-pattern">Rate Limiting Pattern</a></h1>
<p>To prevent excessive resource consumption, some services impose limits on how fast other applications or services can access them. This is called throttling. You can use a rate limiting pattern to reduce or avoid throttling errors caused by these limits and to estimate throughput more accurately.</p>
<p>A rate-limiting pattern can be useful in many situations, but it is especially helpful for large-scale repetitive automated tasks such as batch processing.</p>
<p>By limiting the amount of records supplied to a service during a specific time, rate limiting can lower your traffic and possibly increase throughput.</p>
<p>Various measures may be used to throttle a service over time, including:</p>
<p>— the quantity of actions (60 requests, for instance).<br />
— the volume of data (50 GB per minute, for instance).<br />
— the relative expense of operations (42,000 RUs per second, for instance).</p>
<p>Regardless of the metric employed for throttling, the rate limiting approach you choose will include regulating the volume and/or size of operations delivered to the service over a predetermined time frame in order to maximize your use of the service without going over the throttling limit.</p>
<h1 id="strangler-fig"><a class="header" href="#strangler-fig">Strangler Fig</a></h1>
<p>Migrate a legacy system incrementally by gradually replacing certain functionalities with new apps and services. The old system is eventually choked by the new system, which eventually replaces all of the features of the legacy system, enabling you to decommission it.</p>
<p>Replace specific functionalities in stages with fresh software and services. Make a façade that catches requests headed for the legacy backend system. These requests are forwarded by the façade to either the new services or the legacy application. Customers can use the same interface while existing functionality are progressively moved to the new system, completely ignorant of the transition.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-47.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>This method helps spread out the development work across time and reduce migration risk. You may add functionality to the new system at any rate you like while ensuring the legacy application continues to work because the façade safely directs users to the appropriate application. The legacy system gradually becomes “strangled” and is no longer required over time as features are transferred to the new system. After finishing this procedure, the legacy system can be safely retired.</p>
<p><strong>Health Endpoint Monitoring Pattern</strong></p>
<p>The Health Endpoint Monitoring pattern can be used to ensure that programmes and services are operating properly. This pattern outlines how functional checks should be used in an application. Through open endpoints, external tools have regular access to these checks.</p>
<p>Sending requests to an endpoint on your application will enable health monitoring. After running all essential tests, the programme should indicate its state.</p>
<p>Usually, a health monitoring check combines two elements:</p>
<p>When a request is made to a health verification endpoint, the application or service executes checks, if any.<br />
The evaluation of the outcomes by the system or tool that conducts the health verification check<br />
The response code indicates the application’s status. The status of the app’s components and services may optionally be provided in the response code. The latency or reaction time check is carried out by the monitoring tool or framework.</p>
<p>The pattern is seen in the following figure.</p>

<h2 id="explaining-common-different-architecture-patterns"><a class="header" href="#explaining-common-different-architecture-patterns">Explaining <strong>common</strong> different <strong>architecture patterns</strong></a></h2>
<p>[</p>
<p>An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pattern is a solution to a problem in a context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many programmers are nowadays still confused about the difference between architecture patterns or don’t even know much about it.</p>
<p>Let me explain to you…!</p>
<ul>
<li>Layered Architecture</li>
<li>Pipe and Filter</li>
<li>Client Server</li>
<li>Model View Controller</li>
<li>Event Driven Architecture</li>
<li>Microservices Architecture</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="layered-architecture"><a class="header" href="#layered-architecture"><strong>Layered Architecture</strong></a></h1>
<p>The most common architecture pattern is the layered architecture or known as the n-tier architecture. It is widely known by most software architects, designers, developers. Although, there are no specific restrictions in terms of the number and type of layers that must exist, most layered architecture consists of four tiers: presentation, business, persistence and database as follows.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-15.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>an popular example of n-tier architecture</p>
<h2 id="context-1"><a class="header" href="#context-1"><strong>Context</strong></a></h2>
<p>All complex systems experience the need to develop and evolve portions of the system independently. For this reason, the developers of the system need clear and well-documented separation of concerns, so that modules of the system may be independently developed and maintained.</p>
<h2 id="problem"><a class="header" href="#problem"><strong>Problem</strong></a></h2>
<p>The software needs to be segmented in such a way that the modules can be developed and evolved separately with little interaction among the parts, supporting portability, modifiability, and reuse.</p>
<h2 id="solution"><a class="header" href="#solution"><strong>Solution</strong></a></h2>
<p>To achieve this separation of concerns, the layered pattern divides the software into units called layers. Each layer is a grouping of modules that offers a cohesive set of services. The usage must be unidirectional. Layers completely partition a set of software, and each partition is exposed through a public interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first concept is each of the layers has a specific role and responsibility. For example, the presentation layer would be responsible for handling all UI. Because this separation of concerns within the layered architecture makes it easy to build effective roles and responsibility.</li>
<li>On the second concept, the layered architecture pattern is a technically partitioned architecture as opposed to a domain partitioned architecture. They are groups of components, rather being by domain.</li>
<li>The last concept is that each of the layers in the layered architecture is marked as being either closed or open. A closed layer means that a request moves from layer to layer, it must go through the layer right below it to get to the next layer below that one. The request cannot skip any layers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-16.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p><em>Closed layers and request access</em></p>
<h2 id="weakness"><a class="header" href="#weakness">Weakness</a></h2>
<p>Layers contribute to a performance penalty. The pattern does not lend itself to high-performance applications because it is not efficient to go through multiple layers of the architecture to fulfill a business request.</p>
<p>The addition of layers also adds up-front cost and complexity to a system.</p>
<h2 id="usages"><a class="header" href="#usages">Usages</a></h2>
<p>We should use this style for small, simple applications or websites. It is a good choice for situations with a very tight budget and time constraints.</p>
<h1 id="multi-tier-pattern"><a class="header" href="#multi-tier-pattern">Multi-Tier Pattern</a></h1>
<h2 id="context-2"><a class="header" href="#context-2">Context</a></h2>
<p>In a distributed deployment, there is often a need to distribute a system’s infrastructure into distinct subsets.</p>
<h2 id="problem-1"><a class="header" href="#problem-1">Problem</a></h2>
<p>How can we split the system into a number of computationally independent execution structures: groups of software and hardware connected by some communications media?</p>
<h2 id="solution-1"><a class="header" href="#solution-1">Solution</a></h2>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-17.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>a multi-tier example — consumer website J2EE</p>
<p>The execution structures of many systems are organized as a set of logical groupings of components. Each grouping is termed a tier.</p>
<h2 id="weakness-1"><a class="header" href="#weakness-1">Weakness</a></h2>
<p>Substantial up-front cost and complexity.</p>
<h2 id="usages-1"><a class="header" href="#usages-1">Usages</a></h2>
<p>Used in distributed systems.</p>
<h1 id="pipe-and-filter"><a class="header" href="#pipe-and-filter">Pipe and Filter</a></h1>
<p>One of the patterns in software architecture that appears, again and again, is the pipe-filter pattern.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-18.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>the pipe filter style</p>
<h2 id="context-3"><a class="header" href="#context-3">Context</a></h2>
<p>Many systems are required to transform streams of discrete data items, from input to output. Many types of transformations occur repeatedly in practice, and so it is desirable to create these as independent, reusable parts.</p>
<h2 id="problem-2"><a class="header" href="#problem-2">Problem</a></h2>
<p>Such systems need to be divided into reusable, loosely coupled components with simple, generic interactionmechanisms. In this way they can be flexibly combined with each other. The components, being generic and loosely coupled, are easily reused. The components, being independent, can execute in parallel.</p>
<h2 id="solution-2"><a class="header" href="#solution-2">Solution</a></h2>
<p>Pipes in this architecture form the communication channel between filters. The first concept is each of the pipes is un-directional and point to point for performance reasons, accepting input from one source and always directing output to another.</p>
<p>There are four types of filters exist within this style as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>producer (<code>source</code>): the starting point of a process.</li>
<li>transformer (<code>map</code>): performs a transformation on some or all of the data.</li>
<li>tester (<code>reduce</code>): tests one or more criteria.</li>
<li>consumer (<code>sink</code>): the terminating point.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weakness-2"><a class="header" href="#weakness-2">Weakness</a></h2>
<p>Not good choice for interactive systems, because of their transformational character.</p>
<p>Excessive parsing and unparsing leads toloss of performance and increased complexity in writing the filters themselves.</p>
<h2 id="usages-2"><a class="header" href="#usages-2">Usages</a></h2>
<p>The pipe-filter architecture uses in a variety of applications, especially tasks that facilitate simple, one-way processing such as EDI, ETL tools.</p>
<p>Compilers: the consecutive filters perform lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.</p>
<h1 id="client-server"><a class="header" href="#client-server">Client Server</a></h1>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-19.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h2 id="context-4"><a class="header" href="#context-4">Context</a></h2>
<p>There are shared resources and services that large numbers of distributed clients wish to access, and for which we wish to control access or quality of service.</p>
<h2 id="problem-3"><a class="header" href="#problem-3">Problem</a></h2>
<p>By managing a set of shared resources and services, we can promote modifiability and reuse, by factoring out common services and having to modify these in a single location, or a small number of locations. We want to improve scalability and availability by centralizing the control of these resources and services while distributing the resources themselves across multiple physical servers.</p>
<h2 id="solution-3"><a class="header" href="#solution-3">Solution</a></h2>
<p>In a client-server style, components and connectors have a particular behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>Components, called “clients,” send requests to a component, called “server,” and wait for a reply.</li>
<li>A server component receives a request from a client and sends it the reply.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weakness-3"><a class="header" href="#weakness-3">Weakness</a></h2>
<p>The server can be a performance bottleneck and a single point of failure.</p>
<p>Decisions about where to locate functionality (in the client or in the server) are often complex and costly to change after a system has been built.</p>
<h2 id="usages-3"><a class="header" href="#usages-3">Usages</a></h2>
<p>We can use the client-server style to model a part of a system that has many components sending requests (clients) to another component (server) that offer services: online applications such as email, document sharing and banking.</p>
<h1 id="model-view-controller"><a class="header" href="#model-view-controller">Model View Controller</a></h1>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-20.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h2 id="context-5"><a class="header" href="#context-5">Context</a></h2>
<p>The user interface is typically the most frequently modified portion of an interactive application. Users often wish to look at data from different perspectives, such as a bar graph or a pie chart. These representations should both reflect the current state of the data.</p>
<h2 id="problem-4"><a class="header" href="#problem-4">Problem</a></h2>
<p>How can user interface functionality be kept separate from application functionality and yet still be responsive to user input, or to changes in the underlying application’s data?</p>
<p>And how can multiple views of the user interface be created, maintained, and coordinated when the underlying application data changes?</p>
<h2 id="solution-4"><a class="header" href="#solution-4">Solution</a></h2>
<p>The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern separates application functionality into three kinds of components as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>A model, which contains the application’s data.</li>
<li>A view, which displays some portion of the underlying data and interacts with the user.</li>
<li>A controller, which mediates between the model and the viewand manages the notifications of state changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weakness-4"><a class="header" href="#weakness-4">Weakness</a></h2>
<p>The complexity may not be worth it for simple user interfaces.</p>
<p>The model, view, and controller abstractions may not be good fits for some user interface toolkits.</p>
<h2 id="usages-4"><a class="header" href="#usages-4">Usages</a></h2>
<p>MVC is an architectural pattern that is commonly used in web, mobile applications while developing user interfaces.</p>
<h1 id="event-driven-architecture"><a class="header" href="#event-driven-architecture">Event Driven Architecture</a></h1>
<h2 id="context-6"><a class="header" href="#context-6">Context</a></h2>
<p>Computational and information resources need to be provided to handle incoming independent asynchronous application-generated events in a manner that can scale up as demand increases.</p>
<h2 id="problem-5"><a class="header" href="#problem-5">Problem</a></h2>
<p>Construct distributed systems that can service asynchronous arriving messages associated with an event, and that can scale from small and simple to large and complex.</p>
<h2 id="solution-5"><a class="header" href="#solution-5">Solution</a></h2>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-21.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Deploy independent event processes/processors for event handling. Arriving events are queued. A scheduler pulls events from the queue and distributes them to the appropriate event handler based on a scheduling policy.</p>
<h2 id="weakness-5"><a class="header" href="#weakness-5">Weakness</a></h2>
<p>Performance and error recovery may be issues.</p>
<h2 id="usages-5"><a class="header" href="#usages-5">Usages</a></h2>
<p>An e-commerce application that uses this approach would work as follows:<br />
The Order Service creates an Order in a pending state and publishes an <code>OrderCreated</code> event.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Customer Service receives the event and attempts to reserve credit for that Order. It then publishes either a Credit Reserved event or a <code>CreditLimitExceeded</code> event.</li>
<li>The Order Service receives the event from the Customer Service and changes the state of the order to either approved or canceled</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="microservices-architecture"><a class="header" href="#microservices-architecture">Microservices Architecture</a></h1>
<h2 id="context-7"><a class="header" href="#context-7">Context</a></h2>
<p>Deploy server-based enterprise applications that support a variety of browsers and native mobile clients. The application handles client requests by executing business logic, accessing a database, exchanging messages with other systems, and returning responses. The application might expose a 3rd party API.</p>
<h2 id="problem-6"><a class="header" href="#problem-6">Problem</a></h2>
<p>Monolithic applications can become too large and complex for efficient support, and deployment for optimal distributed resource utilization such as in cloud environments.</p>
<h2 id="solution-6"><a class="header" href="#solution-6">Solution</a></h2>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-22.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Build applications as suites of services. Each service is independently deployable and scalable and has its own API boundary. Different services can be written in different programming languages, manage their own database, and developed by different teams.</p>
<h2 id="weakness-6"><a class="header" href="#weakness-6">Weakness</a></h2>
<p>Systems must be designed to tolerate service failures that require more system monitoring. Service choreography and event collaboration overhead.</p>
<p>We also need more memory.</p>
<h2 id="usages-6"><a class="header" href="#usages-6">Usages</a></h2>
<p>Many use cases are applicable for a microservices architecture, especially those that involve an extensive data pipeline. For example, a microservices-based system would be ideal for a reporting system on a company’s retail store sales. Each step in the data preparation process would be handled by a microservice: data collection, cleansing, normalization, enrichment, aggregation, reporting, etc.</p>
<p>Easy, right?</p>

<p>It’s all about clear, asynchronous communication</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>As a software engineer, it is very important to acquire the skill of writing high-quality documentation. Due to the recent increase in remote work, it has become even more important to be better at asynchronous communication. Remote company GitLab does an excellent job of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">defining asynchronous communication</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Asynchronous communication is the art of communicating and moving projects forward without the need for additional stakeholders to be available at the same time your communique is sent.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>High-quality documentation is an easier way to achieve effective asynchronous communication. In this article, I am going to talk about some interesting tips that I have found very useful in my personal experience.</p>
<h2 id="google-tech-writing-course-1"><a class="header" href="#google-tech-writing-course-1">Google Tech Writing Course</a></h2>
<p>Google offers a free tech writing course for software engineers. It starts with the fundamentals of tech writing. There are two courses and the content is as shown below:</p>

<p>TOC — Google Tech Writing One</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-2.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>Being good at tech writing does not happen overnight. It takes practice. I personally prefer visiting this course each month to remind myself of the best practices.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-divio-documentation-framework-1"><a class="header" href="#using-the-divio-documentation-framework-1">Using the Divio Documentation Framework</a></h2>
<p>Amongst all other documentation frameworks, I personally like <a href="https://www.divio.com/">Divio</a> the best. The documentation systems suggested there are easy and universally applicable.</p>
<p>The framework suggests classifying documentation in the following types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorials — Learning-oriented</li>
<li>How-To Guides — Problem-solving-oriented</li>
<li>Explanation — Understanding-oriented</li>
<li>Reference — Information-oriented</li>
</ul>
<p>The scheme is <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/adoption/#adoption">widely adopted</a> by a lot of famous open source projects and enterprises.</p>
<p>Here is a great video explaining the details of the framework:</p>
<h2 id="use-markdown-based-systems-for-documentation-1"><a class="header" href="#use-markdown-based-systems-for-documentation-1">Use Markdown-Based Systems for Documentation</a></h2>
<p>In a typical enterprise, there are various ways you can maintain your documentation. Some people prefer creating MS Word/Excel documents and uploading those in SharePoint or OneDrives. The biggest problem with such documents is that they are not searchable using your internal search engine. Hence I personally prefer using Markdown-based documentation systems. Creating and maintaining documentation is easy and the documentation is searchable.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Markdown, you can easily master it. Check out this free recommended <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">course</a> from GitHub.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/">Mermaid</a> itself, it “is a Javascript-based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams.” If you are using GitLab or Azure DevOps, Mermaid is natively supported. If you are using GitHub or Atlassian products, then there are plug-ins available.</p>
<p>With Mermaid, creating and updating diagrams is very easy and you don’t need to have any UML tools like Visio/draw.io installed on every developer’s workstation.</p>
<p>Here are some sample diagrams created with Mermaid</p>

<p>Effective branch management is crucial for successful collaboration and efficient development with Git. In this article, we will explore four popular branching strategies — Git-Flow, GitHub-Flow, GitLab-Flow, and Trunk Based Development. By understanding their pros, cons, and ideal use cases, you can determine the most suitable approach for your project.</p>
<h2 id="git-flow"><a class="header" href="#git-flow">Git-Flow</a></h2>
<p>Git-Flow is a comprehensive branching strategy that aims to cover various scenarios. It defines specific branch responsibilities, such as main/master for production, develop for active development, feature for new features, release as a gatekeeper to production, and hotfix for addressing urgent issues. The life-cycle involves branching off from develop, integrating features, creating release branches for testing, merging into main/master, and tagging versions.</p>
<h3 id="pros"><a class="header" href="#pros">Pros</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Well-suited for large teams and aligning work across multiple teams.</li>
<li>Effective handling of multiple product versions.</li>
<li>Clear responsibilities for each branch.</li>
<li>Allows for easy navigation of production versions through tags.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons"><a class="header" href="#cons">Cons</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Complexity due to numerous branches, potentially leading to merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Development and release frequency may be slower due to multi-step process.</li>
<li>Requires team consensus and commitment to adhere to the strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-12.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Git-Flow</p>
<h2 id="github-flow-1"><a class="header" href="#github-flow-1">GitHub-Flow</a></h2>
<p>GitHub-Flow simplifies Git-Flow by eliminating release branches. It revolves around one active development branch (often main or master) that is directly deployed to production. Features and bug fixes are implemented using long-living feature branches. Feedback loops and asynchronous collaboration, common in open-source projects, are encouraged.</p>
<h3 id="pros-1"><a class="header" href="#pros-1">Pros</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Faster feedback cycles and shorter production cycles.</li>
<li>Ideal for asynchronous work in smaller teams.</li>
<li>Agile and easier to comprehend compared to Git-Flow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons-1"><a class="header" href="#cons-1">Cons</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Merging a feature branch implies it is production-ready, potentially introducing bugs without proper testing and a robust CI/CD process.</li>
<li>Long-living branches can complicate the process.</li>
<li>Challenging to scale for larger teams due to increased merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Supporting multiple release versions concurrently is difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-13.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>GitHub-flow</p>
<h2 id="gitlab-flow-1"><a class="header" href="#gitlab-flow-1">GitLab-Flow</a></h2>
<p>GitLab-Flow strikes a balance between Git-Flow and GitHub-Flow. It adopts GitHub-Flow’s simplicity while introducing additional branches representing staging environments before production. The main branch still represents the production environment.</p>
<h3 id="pros-2"><a class="header" href="#pros-2">Pros</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Can handle multiple release versions or stages effectively.</li>
<li>Simpler than Git-Flow.</li>
<li>Focuses on quality with a lean approach.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons-2"><a class="header" href="#cons-2">Cons</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Complexity increases when maintaining multiple versions.</li>
<li>More intricate compared to GitHub-Flow.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-14.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>GitLab-Flow</p>
<h2 id="trunk-based-development"><a class="header" href="#trunk-based-development">Trunk Based Development</a></h2>
<p>Trunk Based Development promotes a single shared branch called “trunk” and eliminates long-living branches. There are two variations based on team size: smaller teams commit directly to the trunk, while larger teams create short-lived feature branches. Frequent integration of smaller feature slices is encouraged to ensure regular merging.</p>
<h3 id="pros-3"><a class="header" href="#pros-3">Pros</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Encourages DevOps and unit testing best practices.</li>
<li>Enhances collaboration and reduces merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Allows for quick releases.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons-3"><a class="header" href="#cons-3">Cons</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Requires an experienced team that can slice features appropriately for regular integration.</li>
<li>Relies on strong CI/CD practices to maintain stability.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-11.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Trunk Based Development — TBD</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Each branching strategy — Git-Flow, GitHub-Flow, GitLab-Flow, and Trunk Based Development — offers its own advantages and considerations. Choosing the right strategy depends on your specific project requirements. Git-Flow suits large teams and complex projects, while GitHub-Flow excels in open-source and small team environments. GitLab-Flow provides a compromise between Git-Flow and GitHub-Flow, while Trunk Based Development is ideal for experienced teams focused on collaboration and quick releases. Select the strategy that aligns with your team’s capabilities, project complexity, and desired workflow to maximize efficiency and success.</p>

<p>The role of a software developer often gets distilled down to a singular activity: coding. While coding is undeniably the heartbeat of the profession, defining a developer by this act alone is akin to defining a painter by their ability to mix colors. It's a crucial part but just the tip of the iceberg. The true essence of a software developer's role combines many different skills, mindsets, and disciplines.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where every software developer is just a coder. In such a world, code might get written, but would it solve any problems? <em>Would the code be even useful or just an implementation of something fancy</em>? The difference between a developer and a great developer is the breadth and depth of their approach in delivering value.</p>
<p>I want to talk more about what makes a great software developer. What are the habits of highly effective developers? And I’m not going to talk about coding (too much).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> <strong>for those who want to know if there's value before they scroll down.</strong> I talk about:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Focusing beyond the code</em> - as a developer you will code 20% of your time. You should excel at coding nonetheless, but it won't be enough to be great.</li>
<li><em>Efficiency / Antifragility</em> — Making sure everything around you runs smoothly and has forward momentum</li>
<li><em>Joy of tinkering</em> - build projects, try out frameworks, build stuff on the side. Keeps the spark alive.</li>
<li><em>Knowing the why</em> — It's important to know why your code does what it does, too many abstractions nowadays that rarely someone thinks below the level of their language e.g JS devs not thinking about the engine that runs their code.</li>
<li><em>Thinking in systems</em> — knowing how your code impacts not only your individual system but other parts of the business/application/life.</li>
<li><em>Tech detox</em> — Recharging away from your monitor makes you a better programmer.</li>
<li><em>The art of approximation</em> — Knowing important tech numbers to approximate calculations when making decisions when programming.</li>
<li>If this sounds interesting there's a few more things like that at the bottom. But you'll have to read it.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></em> <em>Purely subjective thoughts, yours may vary.</em></p>
<h2 id="focusing-beyond-the-code"><a class="header" href="#focusing-beyond-the-code">Focusing beyond the code</a></h2>
<p>Coding is to a developer what a brush is to a painter or a chisel to a sculptor. It's the primary tool, the foundational skill upon which everything else is built. Every application, every website, and every digital solution starts with a line of code. Someone wrote it. You probably write it daily as well.</p>
<p>However, while coding is fundamental, it's essential to recognize that it's not the actual purpose. It's about writing <em>meaningful</em> lines of code. It's about <em>solving problems</em> with the code. A line of code means nothing if there’s no context to it.</p>
<p>Being a great developer means being efficient in coding. It’s not something you can skip. It's the entry ticket to the world of software development. But what separates the good from the great is the ability to see beyond the immediate lines of code. <em>How will it interact with other components? How will it scale? How maintainable is it?</em> These are the questions that a decent software developer constantly grapples with.</p>
<p>We’re not going too deep on the coding; there are better teachers than me out there who share practical wisdom on how to master the machine. Here are some books purely on coding/programming that will boost your skills immensely:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em>, McDowell <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0984782850">[Link to Amazon]</a></li>
<li><em>Introduction to Algorithms</em>, Cormen <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/">[Link to Amazon]</a></li>
<li><em>Clean Code</em>, Martin <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0132350882">[Link to Amazon]</a></li>
<li><em>Coders at Work</em>, Seibel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430219483">[Link to Amazon]</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-pursuit-of-efficiency"><a class="header" href="#the-pursuit-of-efficiency">The Pursuit of Efficiency</a></h2>
<p>All the best developers that I’ve met have been highly efficient. I don’t know how they manage to do it, but it seems they’re always one step ahead of you. It’s a feeling when you’re near them; the progress is felt in the air. Everything moves smoothly — challenges get resolved in a timely matter, and things are under control and moving toward the purpose that the engineer has set.</p>
<p>Great feeling.</p>
<p>Some may argue that efficiency = the <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/why-efficiency-is-dangerous-and-slowing-down-makes-life-better">opposite of stability</a>. But this is not the kind of efficiency I'm talking about. I'm talking more in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility">Antifragility</a>. No running around and doing everything as fast as possible. You don't have to make tradeoffs by reducing the buffers that you have, and be wary of making changes that reduce your resiliency to unexpected things.</p>
<p>So we’re talking about staying efficient. At its core, efficiency is about progress — momentum, ensuring that the wheels of development are always turning. To make it clear what I’m talking about, let’s take a look at the opposite. Every developer knows the feeling of being &quot;stuck&quot; – whether it's a particularly challenging bug — where you start doubting your competence or a piece of code that just won't cooperate. The progress seems to have come to a halt. The pursuit of efficiency, in this case, means not letting these obstacles impede you. It's about thinking on your feet, finding resources to solve the issue, finding alternative solutions, and keeping the end goal in sight.</p>
<pre><code>🏄 Think of it as adopting a proactive mindset, where doing something 
– even if it doesn’t solve your problem directly – is better than doing nothing.
</code></pre>
<p>This means breaking a complex problem into smaller, more manageable tasks. It means seeking input from a colleague when you're feeling stuck or temporarily setting aside a challenging task to focus on another aspect of the project. The key is to maintain forward momentum with small increments.</p>
<p>You might say, <em>“Solving hard problems requires time. You shouldn’t hurry”.</em> And you will be correct. Solving complex problems does require a lot of time. But even solving one big problem has forward momentum — For example getting a new exception after hours of debugging is cause for celebration as you move closer to figuring out the issue.</p>
<h2 id="the-joy-of-tinkering"><a class="header" href="#the-joy-of-tinkering">The Joy of Tinkering</a></h2>
<p>I will be honest: great developers aren't just skilled or knowledgeable; they're passionate. They're eyes light up at the mention of a new programming language. They spend hours diving deep into a challenging problem not just because they have to but because they <em>want</em> to. They're driven by an insatiable curiosity, a hunger to know more, do more, and be more.</p>
<p>I have nothing against people who are not passionate about programming; it’s okay, but these people will also not be pursuing greatness doing 9-5.</p>
<p>This passion manifests itself in various ways, but one of the most evident is the joy of exploration. Great developers are explorers at heart. They're not content with just knowing the tools and technologies of today; they're always on the lookout for what's on the horizon. They tinker, they experiment, they play. Whether it's a new framework, a novel algorithm, or an emerging tech trend, they dive in headfirst, eager to learn, understand, and master.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/nctqc8FBJ2U</p>
<p>So here's George Hotz having great time tinkering with LLaMa and building a chatbot, can you see the joy while he's coding? I find this so cool.</p>
<p>This kind of tinkering keeps the spark alive. In a field as vast and ever-evolving as software development, it's easy to feel overwhelmed or stuck in a rut. However, by embracing curiosity and actively seeking new challenges and learning opportunities, developers can keep their skills sharp and enthusiasm high.</p>
<p>Moreover, this exploration has a more profound, more intrinsic value: the sheer joy of the process. I think great developers also enjoy being passionate about programming. From my personal side, I can tell you I could not see my life without some kind of programming.</p>
<h2 id="knowing-the-why"><a class="header" href="#knowing-the-why">Knowing the Why</a></h2>
<p>Nowadays, developers often find themselves engrossed in specific layers or components, be it perfecting a REST API request or finetuning CSS for that impeccable web design. We’ve gotten very high in abstractions in the last decade or so. Nobody writes assembly, and many developers have never even seen it. Developers usually just work with what they have and don’t ask questions about why it works the way it does. There's an underlying layer of understanding that often goes overlooked: knowing why things are the way they are.</p>
<p>Now, it's a valid argument that a developer doesn't need to be an expert in every layer of the stack. One doesn't need to trace the journey from circuit boards to bits and bytes for every line of code written. But having a foundational understanding and a sense of the bigger picture can be incredibly empowering.</p>
<p><em>Frontend Developers</em> — why and how the CSS is rendered? So many cool things in the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/">Blink rendering engine</a> will change how you think about the page.<br />
<em>Backend Developers</em> — why and how the Python interpreter works? There are so many fascinating things in the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython interpreter/compiler</a> that you’ll be surprised how your code runs.</p>
<p>Knowing the WHY/HOW behind the code offers several advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> When challenges arise, understanding the underlying logic can guide you towards an answer much faster. Even the errors will be clearer when you know how they are thrown.</li>
<li><strong>Informed Decisions:</strong> Your knowledge of the underlying systems will subconsciously influence every decision you make. Whether it's choosing a protocol, seeing a function and understanding immediately it can run in O(n), or ensuring security, a deeper understanding equips a developer to make highly effective decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Bridging Gaps:</strong> In multidisciplinary teams, grasping the broader landscape can foster better communication and collaboration, bridging the gap between specialists of different domains.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Often, groundbreaking solutions emerge at the intersection of disciplines. Knowing the 'why' of various layers can spark innovative ideas and approaches.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not saying you should know everything. It’s more about not just blindly accepting things at face value but delving deeper and expanding one's horizons. I guarantee you this knowledge will be useful to you.</p>
<h2 id="thinking-in-systems"><a class="header" href="#thinking-in-systems">Thinking in Systems</a></h2>
<p>This is similar to the first part of not just focusing on the code but thinking about systems and their interactions. In my eyes, a great developer doesn’t just see the individual pieces; they see the entire puzzle, understanding not only how each piece fits into the current puzzle but also what the puzzle is and if there are more puzzles that need to be interacted with.</p>
<p>Systems thinking is about recognizing that software is made up of numerous components that interact with each other in complex ways. It's not enough to ensure that each component works well separately; it's crucial to understand how it works as part of the whole and what implications it has on the company. Simply — focus not only on unit tests but also E2E tests. It's about asking questions like: <em>Why is this component necessary for the business? If this component fails, how will it impact other systems? How can we design our software to be resilient?</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, systems thinking extends beyond the software itself. Great developers understand that software doesn't exist in a vacuum. It interacts with users, with other systems, with external databases, and even with other non-IT departments.</p>
<p>It's about seeing the forest <em>and</em> the trees, understanding both the macro and the micro level of the things that you develop. Imagine you’re a YouTube Engineer, given a task to improve the algorithm to increase the average time a user spends on YouTube. A straightforward task, you might think, but when you take a step back and look at the issue from a macro level, you’ll see that there are many complex systems at play — from Scalability to UX to moral considerations to legal department.</p>
<p>Or a better, recent example — imagine <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/10/ftx_python_code/">you’re an FTX Engineer</a>, and you’re asked to allow accounts to go into the negative. Again, it is a straightforward feature from the perspective of your individual system — a single line of code. But again, let’s step back and think of the risk management system, compliance system, and every other system affected by this change.</p>
<h2 id="recharging-beyond-the-pixels"><a class="header" href="#recharging-beyond-the-pixels">Recharging Beyond the Pixels</a></h2>
<p>In the digital age, screens have become ubiquitous. From the workstation where you transform code into applications to the smartphones that keep us connected 24/7, technology is an ever-present force in our lives. And for developers, this immersion is even more profound.</p>
<p>Great developers aren't just masters of their craft but well-rounded individuals who understand the value of experiences beyond the digital realm. They recognize that while technology can expand horizons, it can also, paradoxically, become a limiting bubble.</p>
<pre><code>🏄Constant immersion in the digital world can lead to a narrowed perspective. 
There’s so much more outside of the tech bubble.
</code></pre>
<p>I won’t talk too much about the dangers of constant screen time. Physically, it can lead to ailments like eye strain, disrupted sleep patterns, and sedentary lifestyle-related issues. Mentally, it can result in burnout, increased stress, and a feeling of being perpetually &quot;wired.&quot; Moreover, a predominantly online life can lead to a sense of isolation and a disconnection from the tangible, real world around us.</p>
<p>But stepping away from the screens, even momentarily, can work wonders. A tech detox can be incredibly rejuvenating, be it a short walk in the park, a weekend getaway, or even a few hours spent on a non-digital hobby.</p>
<p>Moreover, these breaks from technology serve as a reminder of the bigger picture. They ground us, reminding us of the real-world implications of their work, of the people and communities we serve, and of the myriad experiences and challenges that shape human lives.</p>
<h2 id="the-art-of-approximation"><a class="header" href="#the-art-of-approximation">The Art of Approximation</a></h2>
<p>How fast can you read 10GB from RAM? From SSD? There’s a subtle yet crucial skill that many developers overlook: the art of approximation. It's not about knowing everything but about having a mental toolkit of numbers to guide decisions, shape solutions, and prevent costly missteps.</p>
<p>Amidst the lines of logic and structures, there are numbers that matter. If you're building a high-throughput application, what's the storage cost for logging at 100,000 RPS? While the exact numbers might vary based on various factors, having a rough estimate can be invaluable. It can guide architectural decisions, inform optimizations, and provide a reality check on feasibility.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this cool concept called <em>“The Napkin Math”</em> — for situations where you need to quickly approximate how much it will cost or how fast it will be. In today's cloud-centric world, where scalability and performance are paramount, costs can soon spiral out of control if not kept in check. Being able to approximate calculations on the fly can provide a solid roadmap. It can help you anticipate costs, allocate resources efficiently, and design performant and cost-effective systems.</p>

<p>I won’t talk too in-depth about this - but watch the talk. It’s great.</p>
<h2 id="transfering-knowledge-to-other-problems"><a class="header" href="#transfering-knowledge-to-other-problems">Transfering Knowledge to Other Problems</a></h2>
<p>One of the most profound moments in a student's life is the realization that learning isn't just about absorbing information but understanding its essence and applying it to similar problems. This truth, often first encountered in math classes, extends far beyond the classroom and is especially pertinent in software development.</p>
<p>Think back to those math problems. You'd spend hours understanding a concept, practicing it with a specific set of problems, only to be presented with a different challenge during exams. The numbers changed, the context shifted, but the underlying principle remained unchanged. The real test wasn't just your knowledge of the concept but your ability to adapt and apply it to a new scenario.</p>
<p>I find this adaptability and transfer mindset quite important. Challenges are constant, but they rarely come in familiar packages. A coding solution that worked for one project might not fit another, even if they seem similar. The true mark of a developer's skill is their ability to take their knowledge and mold it to fit the task at hand.</p>
<p>If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.</p>
<p>🏄 Experience plays a pivotal role in this. With each challenge faced, a developer adds to their repertoire, expanding their understanding and refining their approach. I tell my developers, “Every bug you solve today is a skill tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Static knowledge, rigid and unyielding, can become a limitation. The real magic lies in understanding and grasping the core principles so that they can be reshaped and repurposed as needed.</p>
<h2 id="making-hard-things-easy"><a class="header" href="#making-hard-things-easy">Making Hard Things Easy</a></h2>
<p>Julia Evans has a great talk on making hard things easy. That’s where I stole the title of this section as well.</p>
<p>There's a truth often attributed to the genius of Albert Einstein: &quot;If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.&quot; In software engineering especially, the pinnacle of understanding isn't just about mastering the hard things but about making those hard things easy for others.</p>
<p>I’ve met quite a few developers who explained complex things to me in such simple terms that I was surprised that a) I understood it and b) that the concepts were not as complicated as I feared.</p>
<p>For example, I didn’t know much about network programming or Linux sockets. I spent days googling, but the information I found wasn’t really clicking with me. It might say a lot about Google search quality, but then I found the <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/">beej’s guide</a> , and it clicked into place for me.</p>
<p>I think it’s a mark of great engineers if they can explain something and be understood not just by their fellow programmers who work in the same field but also by average people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, making hard things easy is about leveling the playing field. It's about recognizing that knowledge shouldn't be a guarded treasure but a shared resource. By simplifying concepts by making them accessible, you empower others. You give them the tools to rise, to reach your level of understanding, and perhaps even surpass it.</p>

<p>We are going to learn our <strong>Microservices Checklist</strong> and cover <strong>All Aspects</strong> with exploring <strong>vertical topics</strong> of <strong>Microservices Architecture.</strong></p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-23.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Vertical Considerations</p>
<p>Before design any architecture, we should <strong>evaluate</strong> and <strong>verify</strong> some <strong>vertical topics</strong> and <strong>question</strong> to our <strong>architecture</strong> in order to make sure that we have <strong>calculated</strong> every <strong>tradeoffs</strong> and <strong>risks</strong> at acceptable level for your project.</p>
<h2 id="software-architecture-design"><a class="header" href="#software-architecture-design">Software Architecture Design</a></h2>
<p>Software architecture is always a <strong>balancing</strong> act <strong>between trade-offs</strong> and <strong>compromises</strong>. There is no single design or architecture that is perfect for every situation. Instead, software architects must <strong>carefully consider</strong> the <strong>trade-offs</strong> and make decisions based on the specific requirements, constraints, and goals of the software system.</p>
<p>For example, a <strong>monolithic architecture</strong> may be simpler and easier to manage, but it may not scale well as the system grows. On the other hand, a <strong>microservices-based architecture</strong> may provide greater scalability and flexibility, but it may be more complex and difficult to manage. <a href="https://medium.com/design-microservices-architecture-with-patterns/macro-services-to-nano-services-evolution-of-software-architecture-424f927b63cb">In the previous article, you can read the <strong>Evolution of Architectures; Monolithic, Microservices and Serverless.</strong></a></p>
<p>The key point is that <strong>there is no single “best” solution</strong> for software architecture, and software architects must constantly <strong>make trade-offs</strong> and <strong>compromises</strong> based on the <strong>specific requirements</strong>, <strong>constraints</strong>, and <strong>goals</strong> of the system. The goal is to find the <strong>right balance</strong> that meets the needs of the system and the stakeholders.</p>
<p>So to verify any architecture, we should think every aspects of design and make sure that cover all <strong>different angle of the design.</strong> During this article, we will discuss which <strong>vertical considerations</strong> could be think when we design microservices architecture.</p>
<h1 id="microservices-building-blocks"><a class="header" href="#microservices-building-blocks">Microservices Building Blocks</a></h1>
<p>We can start to discuss Vertical Considerations of microservices architectures. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microservices Decomposition — Breaking Down Microservices</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microservices Communications (Sync / Async Message-Based Communication, API Gws)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microservices Data Management (Databases / Query / Commands)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microservices Transaction Management</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microservices Distributed Caching</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microservices Deployments with Containers and Orchestrators</strong></li>

<li><strong>Microservices Testing; Contract Testing, Integration Testing, E2E Test</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microservices Security; Authentication and Authorization</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>with applying microservices design patterns and practices.</p>

<p>Vertical Considerations</p>
<p>According to this image, we can evaluate and verify any architecture with checking all these vertical considerations.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-pragmatic-programmer-quick-reference-guide"><a class="header" href="#the-pragmatic-programmer-quick-reference-guide">The Pragmatic Programmer Quick Reference Guide</a></h1>
<p>This page summarizes the tips and checklists found in <em>The Pragmatic
Programmer</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Care About Your Craft</strong></p>
<p>Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it
well?</p>
<p><strong>Think! About Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and
appraise your work.</p>
<p><strong>Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses</strong></p>
<p>Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done;
explain what can be done.</p>
<p><strong>Don't Live with Broken Windows</strong></p>
<p>Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.</p>
<p><strong>Be a Catalyst for Change</strong></p>
<p>You can't force change on people. Instead, show them how the future
might be and help them participate in creating it.</p>
<p><strong>Remember the Big Picture</strong></p>
<p>Don't get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what's
happening around you.</p>
<p><strong>Make Quality a Requirements Issue</strong></p>
<p>Involve your users in determining the project's real quality
requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio</strong> Make learning a habit.</p>
<p><strong>Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear</strong></p>
<p>Don't be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information
in terms of you and your project.</p>
<p><strong>It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It</strong></p>
<p>There's no point in having great ideas if you don't communicate them
effectively.</p>
<p><strong>DRY--Don't Repeat Yourself</strong></p>
<p>Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative
representation within a system.</p>
<p><strong>Make It Easy to Reuse</strong></p>
<p>If it's easy to reuse, people will. Create an environment that supports
reuse.</p>
<p><strong>Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things</strong></p>
<p>Design components that are self-contained. independent, and have a
single, well-defined purpose.</p>
<p><strong>There Are No Final Decisions</strong></p>
<p>No decision is cast in stone. Instead, consider each as being written in
the sand at the beach, and plan for change.</p>
<p><strong>Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target</strong></p>
<p>Tracer bullets let you home in on your target by trying things and
seeing how close they land.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype to Learn</strong></p>
<p>Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code you
produce, but in the lessons you learn.</p>
<p><strong>Program Close to the Problem Domain</strong> Design and code in your user's
language.</p>
<p><strong>Estimate to Avoid Surprises</strong></p>
<p>Estimate before you start. You'll spot potential problems up front.</p>
<p><strong>Iterate the Schedule with the Code</strong></p>
<p>Use experience you gain as you implement to refine the project time
scales.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Knowledge in Plain Text</strong></p>
<p>Plain text won't become obsolete. It helps leverage your work and
simplifies debugging and testing.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Power of Command Shells</strong></p>
<p>Use the shell when graphical user interfaces don't cut it.</p>
<p><strong>Use a Single Editor Well</strong></p>
<p>The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is
configurable, extensible, and programmable.</p>
<p><strong>Always Use Source Code Control</strong></p>
<p>Source code control is a time machine for your work---you can go back.</p>
<p><strong>Fix the Problem, Not the Blame</strong></p>
<p>It doesn't really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone
else's---it is still your problem, and it still needs to be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Don't Panic When Debugging</strong></p>
<p>Take a deep breath and THINK! about what could be causing the bug.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;select&quot; Isn't Broken.</strong></p>
<p>It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a
third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the
application.</p>
<p><strong>Don't Assume It---Prove It</strong></p>
<p>Prove your assumptions in the actual environment-- with real data and
boundary conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Learn a Text Manipulation Language.</strong></p>
<p>You spend a large part of each day working with text. Why not have the
computer do some of it for you?</p>
<p><strong>Write Code That Writes Code</strong></p>
<p>Code generators increase your productivity and help avoid duplication.</p>
<p><strong>You Can't Write Perfect Software</strong></p>
<p>Software can't be perfect. Protect your code and users from the
inevitable errors.</p>
<p><strong>Design with Contracts</strong></p>
<p>Use contracts to document and verify that code does no more and no less
than it claims to do.</p>
<p><strong>Crash Early</strong></p>
<p>A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.</p>
<p><strong>Use Assertions to Prevent the Impossible</strong></p>
<p>Assertions validate your assumptions. Use them to protect your code from
an uncertain world.</p>
<p><strong>Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems</strong></p>
<p>Exceptions can suffer from all the readability and maintainability
problems of classic spaghetti code. Reserve exceptions for exceptional
things.</p>
<p><strong>Finish What You Start</strong></p>
<p>Where possible, the routine or object that allocates a resource should
be responsible for deallocating it.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize Coupling Between Modules</strong></p>
<p>Avoid coupling by writing &quot;shy&quot; code and applying the Law of Demeter.</p>
<p><strong>Configure, Don't Integrate</strong></p>
<p>Implement technology choices for an application as configuration
options, not through integration or engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata</strong></p>
<p>Program for the general case, and put the specifics outside the compiled
code base.</p>
<p><strong>Analyze Workflow to Improve Concurrency</strong> Exploit concurrency in your
user's workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Design Using Services</strong></p>
<p>Design in terms of services---independent, concurrent objects behind
well-defined, consistent interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Always Design for Concurrency</strong></p>
<p>Allow for concurrency, and you'll design cleaner interfaces with fewer
assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Separate Views from Models</strong></p>
<p>Gain flexibility at low cost by designing your application in terms of
models and views.</p>
<p><strong>Use Blackboards to Coordinate Workflow</strong></p>
<p>Use blackboards to coordinate disparate facts and agents, while
maintaining independence and isolation among participants.</p>
<p><strong>Don't Program by Coincidence</strong></p>
<p>Rely only on reliable things. Beware of accidental complexity, and
don't confuse a happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.</p>
<p><strong>Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms</strong></p>
<p>Get a feel for how long things are likely to take before you write code.</p>
<p><strong>Test Your Estimates</strong></p>
<p>Mathematical analysis of algorithms doesn't tell you everything. Try
timing your code in its target environment.</p>
<p><strong>Refactor Early, Refactor Often</strong></p>
<p>Just as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and
re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Design to Test</strong></p>
<p>Start thinking about testing before you write a line of code.</p>
<p><strong>Test Your Software, or Your Users Will</strong></p>
<p>Test ruthlessly. Don't make your users find bugs for you.</p>
<p><strong>Don't Use Wizard Code You Don't Understand</strong></p>
<p>Wizards can generate reams of code. Make sure you understand all of it
before you incorporate it into your project.</p>
<p><strong>Don't Gather Requirements--Dig for Them</strong></p>
<p>Requirements rarely lie on the surface. They're buried deep beneath
layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.</p>
<p><strong>Workwith a User to Think Like a User</strong></p>
<p>It's the best way to gain insight into how the system will really be
used.</p>
<p><strong>Abstractions Live Longer than Details</strong></p>
<p>Invest in the abstraction, not the implementation. Abstractions can
survive the barrage of changes from different implementations and new
technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Use a Project Glossary</strong></p>
<p>Create and maintain a single source of all the specific terms and
vocabulary for a project.</p>
<p><strong>Don't Think Outside the Box--Find the Box</strong></p>
<p>When faced with an impossible problem, identify the real constraints.
Ask yourself: &quot;Does it have to be done this way? Does it have to be
done at all?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Start When You're Ready.</strong></p>
<p>You've been building experience all your life. Don't ignore niggling
doubts.</p>
<p><strong>Some Things Are Better Done than Described</strong></p>
<p>Don't fall into the specification spiral---at some point you need to
start coding.</p>
<p><strong>Don't Be a Slave to Formal Methods.</strong></p>
<p>Don't blindly adopt any technique without putting it into the context
of your development practices and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Costly Tools Don't Produce Better Designs</strong></p>
<p>Beware of vendor hype, industry dogma, and the aura of the price tag.
Judge tools on their merits.</p>
<p><strong>Organize Teams Around Functionality</strong></p>
<p>Don't separate designers from coders, testers from data modelers. Build
teams the way you build code.</p>
<p><strong>Don't Use Manual Procedures</strong></p>
<p>A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the
same order, time after time.</p>
<p><strong>Test Early. Test Often. Test Automatically</strong></p>
<p>Tests that run with every build are much more effective than test plans
that sit on a shelf.</p>
<p><strong>Coding Ain't Done 'Til All the Tests Run</strong> 'Nuff said.</p>
<p><strong>Use Saboteurs to Test Your Testing</strong></p>
<p>Introduce bugs on purpose in a separate copy of the source to verify
that testing will catch them.</p>
<p><strong>Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage</strong></p>
<p>Identify and test significant program states. Just testing lines of code
isn't enough.</p>
<p><strong>Find Bugs Once</strong></p>
<p>Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human
tester finds that bug. Automatic tests should check for it from then on.</p>
<p><strong>English is Just a Programming Language</strong></p>
<p>Write documents as you would write code: honor the DRY principle, use
metadata, MVC, automatic generation, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On</strong></p>
<p>Documentation created separately from code is less likely to be correct
and up to date.</p>
<p><strong>Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations</strong></p>
<p>Come to understand your users' expectations, then deliver just that
little bit more.</p>
<p><strong>Sign Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should
be, too.</p>
<p><strong>Languages To Learn</strong></p>
<p>Tired of C, C++, and Java? Try CLOS, Dylan, Eiffel, Objective C, Prolog,
Smalltalk, or TOM. Each of these languages has different capabilities
and a different &quot;flavor.&quot; Try a small project at home using one or
more of them.</p>
<p><strong>The WISDOM Acrostic</strong></p>
<p><strong>W</strong>hat do you want them to learn?</p>
<p>What <strong>i</strong>s their interest in what you've got to say?</p>
<p>How <strong>s</strong>ophisticated are they?</p>
<p>How much <strong>d</strong>etail do they want?</p>
<p>Whom do you want to <strong>o</strong>wn the information?</p>
<p>How can you <strong>m</strong>otivate them to listen to you?</p>
<p><strong>How to Maintain Orthogonality</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Design independent, well-defined components.</p>
<p>Keep your code decoupled.</p>
<p>Avoid global data.</p>
<p>Refactor similar functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Things to prototype</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Architecture</p>
<p>New functionality in an existing system</p>
<p>Structure or contents of external data</p>
<p>Third-party tools or components Performance issues</p>
<p>User interface design</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Architectural Questions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are responsibilities well defined?</p>
<p>Are the collaborations well defined?</p>
<p>Is coupling minimized?</p>

<p>Every once in a while as a developer you find yourself stepping, and falling, into a much deeper rabbit hole than you would expect. I recently had one of these experiences as I have dug into the world of unique identifiers. It is this rabbit hole that I would like to take you down for a bit as well. Unique identifiers are everywhere in our code and our data storage and through better understanding what they are and the trade-offs between them we can make more educated decisions in our day-to-day work.</p>
<h2 id="where-we-began"><a class="header" href="#where-we-began">Where we began:</a></h2>
<p>Historically a lot of software has used incrementing numbers to represent the identifier of a particular piece of data. They can be auto-generated by many data stores, they are easy to reason about, are efficient to store and sort, are naturally time ordered, and can be easy to say (ex: “Hey Marsha, can you take a look at record 3162?”). It is for many of these reasons that the industry used these identifiers for so long.</p>
<p>That being said, there are also downsides to using incrementing numbers as identifiers especially as we start working in “web-scale” applications. Due to the sequential nature of data you often aren’t able to generate these identifiers concurrently. You could use techniques like skipping so many values for each generation and having different starting points for each generator or starting at different numbers but these all have various shortcomings as well versus a system that could generate identifiers without any coordination. If you separate the work of ID generation to another system that system could become a single point of failure and/or slow down the performance of your application as you need to make round trips between the requesting application and the ID generation system.</p>
<p>Incrementing IDs also can lead to data leakage in that you now have easily guessable identifiers in URLs or other locations that people can exploit to test out your defenses. They can also divulge the size of your dataset. For example, if I sign up for an account with a website and the profile page’s URL ends with <code>user/515</code>I can make the educated guess that there are 515 accounts on the service. The less information you can give an adversary the better. I have actually stumbled upon production systems that were easily exploitable via lacking authorization and using incrementable identifiers. This particular system included personal information about employees of another company and thankfully after disclosing this vulnerability to the company they were able to patch the issue. That is not to say if you were using a non-guessable identifier you don’t need authorization checks but it does add another layer to get through.</p>
<h2 id="uuids-to-the-rescue"><a class="header" href="#uuids-to-the-rescue">UUIDs to the rescue?</a></h2>
<p>For all the above reasons many different applications needed to find another way to generate unique identifiers while allowing data hiding and scalability. Enter <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt">RFC 4122</a> UUIDs. UUID are identifiers backed by a 128-bit value typically expressed as a 32 hexadecimal characters generated via random or time-based means. They look something like: <code>93f9a654-7467-46de-9964-f30a66104dd9.</code>These identifiers have numerous benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many different processes can generate identifiers concurrently without coordination with an extremely low chance of collisions.</li>
<li>They are less guessable than sequential IDs.</li>
<li>They don’t give you a sense of the size of the dataset.</li>
<li>They are still reasonably small when compared to a 32 random character identifier. They are also much easier for a database engine to compare than 32 characters of text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the definition of a UUID as a 128-bit number generated via time and randomness-based methods you may think there could be many ways of going about this and you would be correct. There are several official versions of UUID:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type 1 — ID is based on the generating host’s MAC address and a timestamp. Reasonable choice for concurrent generation but falls flat on the low guessability spectrum.</li>
<li>Type 2 — The often ignored version as there isn’t a formal definition of it in the RFC and thus is ignored by many UUID tools but there is a definition provided by the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9696989899/chap5.htm#tagcjh_08_02_01_01">DCE 1.1 Authentication and Security Services specification</a>. It uses a host’s MAC address, timestamp, a “local domain” number, and “integer identifier meaningful within the specified local domain”</li>
<li>Type 3 — Generated via an MD5 hash of a provided input data. This allows the generation of the same UUID based on the same input.</li>
<li>Type 4 — Entirely random data is used to generate the bits of the changing part of the UUID</li>
<li>Type 5 — Like type 3 it is based on an input value but in this case it is SHA-1 hashed which is a better hashing algorithm for this use case than MD5 so it should be preferred over Type 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically any modern language has built-in functionality to generate one or multiple of these types of UUIDs or there are readily available libraries to facilitate their generation. We also have first-class support for UUID in many database platforms.</p>
<p>There are downsides to UUIDs though. Although they are reasonably small they still take up much more space than many other identifiers. Their random nature also makes them particularly troublesome for relational databases to handle as, especially if they are used in a clustered index, they can force the reordering in its internal data structures to put in new entries. In general this lack of built-in sortability based on time becomes the root of a lot of issues. In a lot of circumstances you may not already have another piece of data to sort based on and you are forced to add one because your identifier can’t also facilitate the process even though it feels like it could.</p>
<h2 id="a-world-beyond-uuids"><a class="header" href="#a-world-beyond-uuids">A World Beyond UUIDs</a></h2>
<p>For the reasons above and many others, UUIDs aren’t a one-size-meets-all solution. Thus, unsurprisingly, many other implementations of identifier generation have been created and there is an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format#ref-LexicalUUID">IETF RFC</a> that details that a UUID version more appropriate to be used as a database key with an ordering component should be decided upon (update: they have a <a href="https://kylec32.medium.com/analyzing-new-unique-identifier-formats-uuidv6-uuidv7-and-uuidv8-d6cc5cd7391a">draft specification</a>). As part of this RFC, it refers to a number of existing implementations as prior art. Let’s consider a few of them:</p>
<h2 id="ulid-reference"><a class="header" href="#ulid-reference">ULID (<a href="https://github.com/ulid/spec">reference</a>)</a></h2>
<p>Unique Lexicographically IDentifiers (<a href="https://github.com/ulid/spec">ULID</a>) are one such attempt at solving some of the above UUID issues. They are made up of two components, a Unix millisecond-level timestamp and a random portion put together like below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">01AN4Z07BY      79KA1307SR9X4MV3  
  
|----------|    |----------------|  
 Timestamp          Randomness  
   48bits             80bits
</code></pre>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lexicographical (Alphabetical) sorting.</li>
<li>Commonly encoded in 26 characters vs the 36 characters of UUID</li>
<li>Monotonic sort order. (The code handles the case of multiple generations per millisecond and making sure they sort in that particular order)</li>
<li>Being 128 bits they are compatible with UUIDs 128 bits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are required to be compared case insensitively. This could be a potential gotcha for implementing developers.</li>
<li>They still weigh in at 128 bits making them no smaller than UUIDs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="snowflake-twitters-now-defunct-solution"><a class="header" href="#snowflake-twitters-now-defunct-solution"><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2010/announcing-snowflake">Snowflake</a> (Twitter’s now <a href="https://github.com/twitter-archive/snowflake">defunct</a> solution)</a></h2>
<p>Although it’s no longer supported I think it’s intriguing to look at Twitter’s Snowflake service that they historically used for the generation of tweet IDs. Twitter seemed to be a trend setter with this solution as you will see below a lot of other solutions built on top of the ideas of Snowflake. Snowflake worked as a Thrift service that used Zookeeper to facilitate a cluster of services that could be used for quickly retrieving new identifiers.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The identifiers were 64 bits, half the size of UUIDs, allowing for more efficient storage.</li>
<li>Fairly strong ordering guarantees.</li>
<li>Distributed in a way that allows survival of losing a node.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces the complexity of monitoring and maintaining a Zookeeper cluster which if a particular company didn’t already have could be a large burden.</li>
<li>You also need to maintain a cluster of identifier generation services (the actual Snowflake servers)</li>
<li>The complexity and requirements of a distributed system are now part of your identitifer generation solution with cross cluster communication and other complexities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although no longer supported, you can see the original code <a href="https://github.com/twitter-archive/snowflake/tree/snowflake-2010">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="flickrs-ticket-server-blog-post"><a class="header" href="#flickrs-ticket-server-blog-post">Flickr’s Ticket Server (<a href="https://code.flickr.net/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-unique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/">blog post</a>)</a></h2>
<p>This is much more of a pattern than a particular tool or library. The basic idea of the ticket server is to have a service that is backed by a database that has an auto incrementing column maintained by the database engine that gets meted out to requesters. Now you can focus exclusively on optimizing this very specific use case and put off much of the heavy lifting to the database engine. In Flickr’s case, they load-balanced between two different service instances, one that did odd numbers and one that did even numbers to allow some resilience and load balancing.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can set how big you want your identifier to be. (In Flickr’s blog post they set it to 20 bits)</li>
<li>There are minimal moving parts.</li>
<li>It allows for some resilience if you break up the keyspace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to add more backing services it could be difficult as you need to change them all together so they don’t clash.</li>
<li>Strong ordering is only guarenteed only within a single keyspace so if you split it in half like Flickr did you can end up with half your key space quite divered from the other half of your keyspace.</li>
<li>This is still the maintenance overhead of maintaining the ticket servers and DBs. Although less than something like Snowflake it is more than a lot of the other solutions that will be discussed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Twitter has put a lot of thought and work into unique ID generation as we see another reference to Twitter’s tooling here in this list. This time as part of its client library for Cassandra. Unlike Snowflake, these are 128 bits like traditional UUIDs. The most significant 64 bits are a timestamp retrieved from Cassie’s built-in internal clock implementation and the least significant 64 bits are based on the worker ID.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not seem to require any additional infrastructure like Snowflake.</li>
<li>128 bits makes it compatible with other UUID implementations.</li>
<li>Gives you a strong time ordering guarantee within the same worker and weak ordering guarantees across works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just as many bits as UUID</li>
<li>Not strict ordering guarantees.</li>
<li>Seems tightly coupled with the Cassie library.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another defunct tool/company but always something new to learn from these tools. As the name suggests this particular implementation takes its origins from Twitter’s Snowflake discussed above. It however makes some changes. It moves back up to 128 bits and with that trade-off it can avoid any coordination between nodes. The results are still roughly time ordered. It is formatted as follows: 64 bit Unix timestamp, 48-bit worker ID (based on MAC address), and 16-bit sequence. It was also implemented in Erlang so that’s another fun piece of information.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>No coordination is needed between generation nodes.</li>
<li>128 bit compatible with UUID</li>
<li>Roughly time ordered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predictable by design (very much built like a UUIDv1 but done so that it can be roughly time sorted)</li>
<li>Still 128 bits.</li>
<li>Not exactly time ordered.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instagrams-shardingid-blog-post"><a class="header" href="#instagrams-shardingid-blog-post">Instagram’s ShardingID (<a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c">blog post</a>)</a></h2>
<p>To make sense of Instagram’s system you have to understand somewhat how they shard their databases. They have created thousands of “logical” shards of their data that each represents part of their data. These logical shards end up being schema’s in their databases so they could have from 1 — # of shards physical database engines behind their data to split between. It’s a fairly simple concept but a powerful one I would say. Instagram wanted to optimize for simplicity so they wanted to stay away from bringing in new tools and services to support. What they ended up with was a 64-bit identifier. The first 41 bits represent a timestamp in milliseconds (which gives them 41 years of IDs because they use a custom epoch), 13 bits as the logical shard id, and the final 10 bits serve as a sequence number for the value within the millisecond. They then wrote a custom PL/PGSQL function that generates these values within their database.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>No coordination is needed between servers.</li>
<li>Uses existing infrastructure</li>
<li>64-bit identifier.</li>
<li>Extremely simple to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strongly relies on their logical sharding system.</li>
<li>41 years doesn’t seem like a whole lot of time to be acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ksuid-reference"><a class="header" href="#ksuid-reference">KSUID (r<a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid">eference</a>)</a></h2>
<p>Another generally sortable unique identifier generation tool. It uses 160 bits. A 32-bit timestamp and then 128 bits of random-based payload. It uses a modified epoch for its timestamp, giving it over 100 years of life. The text representation is 27 characters with the bits being encoded with base62 which makes it also generically time sortable via its string representation as well.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordination free</li>
<li>Long life</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>At 160 bits it’s larger than UUID’s 128</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="elasticflake-reference"><a class="header" href="#elasticflake-reference">ElasticFlake (<a href="https://github.com/ppearcy/elasticflake">reference</a>)</a></h2>
<p>This library is an extraction of the identifier generation code from ElasticSearch. It ends up being 120 bits with 48 bits of timestamp, a 48 bit MAC address, and 24 bits for a sequence at the end.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly smaller than UUID</li>
<li>Battle-hardened inside of ElasticSearch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>MAC addresses give predictability to identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flake-idgen-reference"><a class="header" href="#flake-idgen-reference">Flake IDGen (<a href="https://github.com/T-PWK/flake-idgen">reference</a>)</a></h2>
<p>This identifier generation method brings in the concept of data centers as part of the identifier. The only reason I would think you would want this would be to be able to determine where an identifier was generated although I’m not sure why that would be useful. This can be useful internally but also perpetuate one of the downsides of some of the UUID versions in that they expose information. These are generated as 64-bit identifiers with a 42-bit timestamp, a 5-bit datacenter identifier, a 5-bit worker identifier, and a 12 bit counter.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 64 bits.</li>
<li>Allows tracking back to which data center generated an identifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less room for workers and sequence counts.</li>
<li>Exposes more information than a lot of the other methods.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sonyflake-reference"><a class="header" href="#sonyflake-reference"><a href="https://github.com/sony/sonyflake">Sonyflake (reference)</a></a></h2>
<p>Next, we get Sony’s take on Twitter’s Snowflake pattern. This time we have 63 bits which is intriguing. Another interesting piece to this one is that the timestamp is scoped down to 10-millisecond buckets rather than down to the millisecond like most of the other systems discussed here. This gives it a longer life (174 years). The bit layout is as follows: 39 bits of timestamp, 8 bits for sequence numbers, 16 bits as a worker ID.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quite small.</li>
<li>Coordination free.</li>
<li>Long life (174 years)</li>
<li>Can handle more workers than Snowflake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timestamp can only be scoped to 10-millisecond buckets.</li>
<li>Fewer identifiers can be generated in a particular 10 millisecond period due to smaller sequence.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ordereduuid-reference"><a class="header" href="#ordereduuid-reference">OrderedUUID (<a href="https://itnext.io/laravel-the-mysterious-ordered-uuid-29e7500b4f8">reference</a>)</a></h2>
<p>We now look at Laravel’s OrderedUUID. This one takes the unique goal of wanting to look and act like a UUIDv4 that just so happens to have time-based higher-order bits. This being the goal its String representation looks exactly like a UUIDv4 and it includes the version and variant identifiers required by the UUID specification. The way it is built however is different. The first 48 bits are the timestamp, it has 72 bits of randomness, and then the UUIDv4 required pieces take up the remaining 8 bits.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>No coordination is needed.</li>
<li>Identical to UUIDs, thus support is not needed for a new scheme for consumers of the IDs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still 128 bits.</li>
<li>Being so identical to UUIDv4 I think it could be easy to mix up and not be able to tell what you were looking at.</li>
<li>Exposes generation time if that is a concern (it does not expose a sequence though)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="combguid-reference"><a class="header" href="#combguid-reference">COMBGUID (<a href="https://github.com/richardtallent/RT.Comb">reference</a>)</a></h2>
<p>These identifiers come from the SQL Server world. Presented with the problems of clustered indexes as well as the shortcomings of <code>newsequentialid</code> with not having true ordering, this identifier was born. This identifier devotes 76 bits to randomness and 48 bits to the timestamp, the last 4 bits are for the UUID identifier.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally ordered IDs.</li>
<li>Looks like and validates like a UUID</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides</p>
<ul>
<li>Timestamp goes down to the 1/300th of a second which isn’t millisecond precision that others provide.</li>
</ul>

<p>This one comes to us courtesy of Google, specifically Firebase. These IDs are used to allow extremely concurrent interactions with a data structure by many remote clients. These identifiers are generated client-side and are 120 bits. The first 48 bits represent a millisecond precision timestamp and the following 72 bits are random bits. They also can handle generation within the same millisecond by simply incrementing the random bits. With clients creating the timestamps I think the ordering guarantees in this system are probably weaker than environments where the timestamp generation is more tightly controlled but it is still likely generally in the right direction.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 120 bits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-side generation of this particular implementation brings its own troubles.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objectid-reference"><a class="header" href="#objectid-reference">ObjectId (<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/">reference</a>)</a></h2>
<p>Now we have an identifier generation from MongoDB. This one weighs in at 96 bits. We have 32 bits of timestamp, 40 bits of randomness, and 24 bits of an incrementing value initialized to a random value. All of this is represented in a 24 character hexadecimal string.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>96 bits is smaller than many options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the lower side of random bits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xid-reference"><a class="header" href="#xid-reference">xid (<a href="https://github.com/rs/xid">reference</a>)</a></h2>
<p>This claims to be an iteration on Mongo’s ObjectId discussed above and simply changes the encoding scheme to String to instead use Base32 hex to take the string representation from 24 to 20 characters long. That being said, it does describe its bit structure differently than ObjectId does. Its bits are laid out as follows: 32-bit timestamp, 24-bit machine identifier, 16-bit process id, and 24-bits as an incrementing value starting at a random value.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller string representation than ObjectId and smaller than most.</li>
<li>96 bits is smaller than many options</li>
<li>Claims to be bit compatible with ObjectId</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>

<p>This identifier generation process seems to be focused on the text representation along with order. It comes out with a 25 character identifier with the following structure. Always starts with the character <code>c</code> , eight characters of timestamp, a four-digit counter that rolls over, four characters for a client fingerprint, and 8 characters of randomness.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seems to have first-class support for generation via client-side Javascript.</li>
<li>Less focus on the actual bits makes it a little easier to reason about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seems to be more of a wild west of what all the pieces mean and how they are encoded. (ex: How do you create a client fingerprint, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a ton of options to choose from. Some are extremely different in their implementations and some are only different in the slightest of ways. What is clear is you need to know what you are optimizing for in your environment before choosing a identifier generation algorithm. Are you looking for the absolute smallest space-taking identifier possible? Are you trying to use the same tools you are already using or are you open to bringing in new tools? How many identifiers will be generated in a second? How in order should they attempt to be? All important questions and the answers will be different for each environment. I love how much sharing of ideas there is in the world and how we can learn from all of these uses cases and we all can build on the shoulders of those that went before us.</p>

<h1 id="why-do-you-need-a-guid"><a class="header" href="#why-do-you-need-a-guid">Why do you need a GUID?</a></h1>
<p>GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) are generators for identifiers typically used as primary keys in databases. GUID solve problems typically inherent to three tiers architectures, more precisely:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong> — growing hardware vertically has its limits, soon or later multiple instances are required to sustain the load. Centralized id generators have a significant (negative) impact on performance. GUID typically allow distributing generators across multiple instances.</li>
<li><strong>Resilience</strong> — the ability to run multiple instances of a generator is a great way to improve its availablity and avoid a single point of failure.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> — sequences are trivial to predict, in a distributed world different sources of entropy are used to guarantee uniqueness via a random, difficult to predict (long) string.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>At this point you should have a pretty good idea of the different implementations and how they compare. Let us add some context...</em></p>
<h2 id="are-csprng-implementations-broken"><a class="header" href="#are-csprng-implementations-broken">Are CSPRNG implementations broken?</a></h2>
<p>Some were, others are, mostly in (old) browsers.</p>
<p>Remember that, even if ID generation takes place <strong>server side,</strong> where implementations are more stable and uniform: <strong>you must be vigilant</strong>. <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/math-random">Here</a> is a security post on the topic regarding NodeJS (2015).</p>
<h2 id="is-randomness-a-pledge-for-security"><a class="header" href="#is-randomness-a-pledge-for-security">Is Randomness a pledge for security?</a></h2>
<p>Machines run algorithms that approximate randomness by selecting algorithms and trusted entropy sources. A cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) is a algorithm with properties that make it suitable for use in cryptography. On Linux for instance, the kernel gathers noisy data from various devices and transfers them to an internal pool of entropy.</p>
<p>Unfortunate, not all cryptography stacks are equal. For instance, old versions of CSPRNG are famous for their poor implementations in JavaScript or PHP. Algorithms such as SHA1 also proved to be unsecured but are still used today in some GUID generators.</p>
<p>While ensuring that a GUID generator is cryptography certified is important, <strong>an ID is nothing in view of a proper security architecture.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-odds-of-a-collisions"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-odds-of-a-collisions">What are the odds of a collisions?</a></h2>
<p>The answer depends on the use case and the specifics of a GUID implementation</p>
<p>With that said, the advertised Math is probably not a good reflection of reality: In an application, a GUID is used to create a multitude of different entities. These entities by definition do not overlap with one another and are therefore in their own <em>space</em>, further reducing the chances of collisions.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-risk-to-leak-the-id-generation-date"><a class="header" href="#is-there-a-risk-to-leak-the-id-generation-date">Is there a risk to leak the id generation date?</a></h2>
<p>It all depends on <em>requirements</em>.</p>
<p><strong>From a legal standpoint</strong>, some will argue that the ID generation date is PII data. While this classification could not be validated, a lawyer friend of mine found the argument difficult to defend in a court without considering the complete architecture.</p>
<p><strong>From a security standpoint</strong>, very unlikely but it depends on your use case. Zendesk recently wrote <a href="https://zendesk.engineering/how-probable-are-collisions-with-ulids-monotonic-option-d604d3ed2de">an article on the topic</a>, recommended.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-way-to-mitigate-security-and-performance"><a class="header" href="#is-there-a-way-to-mitigate-security-and-performance">Is there a way to mitigate security and performance?</a></h2>
<p>There are designs which leverage different GUID implementations where they best fit. For instance, it is common in cloud database nowadays to provide an out of the box time-based guid. if this implementation is not sufficient to satisfy security requirements, the notion of internal and external id can be implemented on entities.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-59.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h2 id="is-generation-performance-a-key-factor"><a class="header" href="#is-generation-performance-a-key-factor">Is generation performance a key factor?</a></h2>
<p>In complete honesty, it’s probably not. The fact is, in terms of pseudo-random generation, <strong>velocity is generally not a factor of security.</strong> Besides even the slowest implementation still generates ids at 60000 ops/s on a single machine.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-choose"><a class="header" href="#how-to-choose">How to choose?</a></h1>
<p>With so many dimensions, what are the points to consider?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>entropy length</strong> — this has direct impact on collisions and predictability, I would recommend avoiding anything with an entropy length &lt; 62 bits unless you understand what you are doing.</li>
<li><strong>random generator quality</strong> — not all random generators are made equal, ensure the implementation uses a cryptography secure random. <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/google-chromes-javascript-engine-finally-returns-actual-random-numbers">Do not trust!</a> <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=552749">again DO NOT trust!</a></li>
<li><strong>scalability</strong> — with so many options available, I would recommend an implementation which can scale horizontally.</li>
</ol>
<p>The remaining decision points are specific to your requirements.</p>
<p>When ids are stored in a RDBMS database, I had successes with ULID and UUIDv7, for transient ids typically stored in memory or in the browser, I would recommend nanoid.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-2"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-2">Conclusion</a></h1>
<p>We reached the end of this article. We learned that picking the right GUID flavor depends entirely on your requirements. You should be vigilent to the constraints of your specific use case, the data being leaked (if any), the CSPRNG implementation it uses or if you plan to store it as a primary key.</p>

<p><em>This section helps clarify some of the terms used in this document.</em></p>
<p>Collisions</p>
<p>A hash collision is a random match in hash values that occurs when a hashing algorithm produces the same hash value for two distinct pieces of data.</p>
<p>Coordination</p>
<p>The communication between the different elements of a complex activity so as to enable them to work together effectively.</p>
<p>Entropy</p>
<p>In Cryptography, refers to the randomness collected by a system for use in algorithms that require random seeds. (jargon word for “randomness”)</p>
<p>Monotonic</p>
<p>A monotonic generator ensures ids are always sorted in order. This term is particularly relevant to date based guid generators which are based on time. For a given instance, at instant T, the next id should always be sorted.</p>
<p>Opaque</p>
<p>An opaque identifier is one that doesn’t expose its inner details or structure.</p>
<p>Pagination</p>
<p>Pagination is a process that is used to divide a large data into smaller discrete pages. Commonly used in customer facing applications, pagination requires the notion of pointers on the dataset.</p>
<p>Predictable</p>
<p>A random number generator is predictable if, after observing some of its “random” output, we can make accurate predictions about what “random values” are coming up next.</p>
<p>Randomness</p>
<p>Randomness (entropy) is the cornerstone of cryptography. The more random the numbers, the more secure the cryptographic system. The challenge then, becomes one of generating true randomness.</p>

<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-41.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>In the tech world, change is constant.</p>
<p>Technologies come and go, and what was once cutting-edge is replaced by the new and improved. It’s no secret that the technology landscape is constantly evolving, so it’s important for organizations to plan ahead and stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Then the question is, <em>how do you stay ahead of the curve when new technologies are introduced daily?</em></p>
<p>This is where the <strong>MACH Architecture</strong> comes into the picture. MACH architecture is</p>
<ul>
<li>agile</li>
<li>flexible</li>
<li>future-proof</li>
<li>scalable</li>
</ul>
<p>For all these reasons, it’s no secret that MACH architecture is on the rise. With its growing popularity, many people are curious about MACH architecture and how it works.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, we’ll look at <strong>MACH architecture</strong>, how it works, and what benefits it can offer your business in 2023.</p>
<p>Whether you’re just starting out with MACH architecture or you’re looking to expand your knowledge base, this guide has everything you need to get up to speed.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-mach-technology"><a class="header" href="#what-is-mach-technology">What Is MACH Technology?</a></h1>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-42.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with composable digital experience space, you might ask yourself, ‘what does MACH mean?’ <strong>MACH</strong> is an acronym that stands for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>M</strong>icroservices-Based</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>PI-First</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>loud-Native</li>
<li><strong>H</strong>eadless</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>MACH technology</strong> is a powerful approach to software development that focuses on developing microservices-based, API-first, cloud-native applications that are headless. This innovative approach allows developers to create highly scalable, efficient, and flexible applications that can easily adapt to changing business needs.</p>
<p>The MACH technology stems from the principles of agile development, which emphasizes rapid delivery and continuous improvement. By breaking down large applications into smaller modular units called microservices, MACH enables teams to iterate quickly and respond effectively to new requirements or changes in the market.</p>
<h2 id="microservices-based"><a class="header" href="#microservices-based">Microservices-Based</a></h2>
<p>Microservices is an approach to software development whereby an application is decomposed into a number of small, independently developed, and deployable services.</p>
<p>This approach has a number of benefits over traditional, monolithic development techniques.</p>
<p>Firstly, it enables much greater flexibility in terms of deployment and scalability. Secondly, it allows for greater reuse of code and easier maintenance. Finally, it facilitates a more rapid development cycle as features can be developed and deployed independently of one another.</p>
<p>As a result, microservices-based applications are becoming increasingly popular, particularly in the cloud computing domain.</p>
<h2 id="api-first"><a class="header" href="#api-first">API-First</a></h2>
<p>An API-First approach is a strategy for designing and developing software applications in which the application’s programming interface (API) is given priority over other components.</p>
<p>The advantage of this approach is that it allows developers to create an API that can be easily integrated into other software applications, making it easier to share data and functionality between different systems.</p>
<p>In addition, using an API-first approach can also help to ensure that the application’s UI is consistent with the underlying API, making it easier for users to understand and use the application.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-native-1"><a class="header" href="#cloud-native-1">Cloud-Native</a></h2>
<p>The term “Cloud-Native” is used to describe applications that are designed specifically for deployment in the cloud.</p>
<p>Cloud-Native apps are typically built using microservices, which are small, self-contained components that can be deployed and scaled independently. This approach differs from traditional monolithic applications, which are large and complex, with tightly coupled dependencies.</p>
<p>Cloud-native apps are also designed to be highly resilient, with each microservice being independently scalable and replaceable. This approach enables organizations to quickly adapt to changing conditions and ensure that their apps remain available even in the event of an outage.</p>
<p>As the demand for cloud-based applications continues to grow, the need for cloud-native solutions will become increasingly important.</p>
<h2 id="headless"><a class="header" href="#headless">Headless</a></h2>
<p>Headless architecture is a type of software architecture that decouples the front-end user interface from the back-end logic enabling a framework-agnostic technology structure.</p>
<p>In a headless system, the backend provides an API that delivers content to the frontend. This separation of concerns allows for greater flexibility and scalability.</p>
<p>By decoupling the frontend and backend, developers can more easily make changes to either one without affecting the other. This approach also makes it easier to scale individual components of the system as needed.</p>
<h1 id="mach-alliance"><a class="header" href="#mach-alliance">MACH Alliance</a></h1>

<h1 id="mach-architecture"><a class="header" href="#mach-architecture">MACH Architecture</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-mach-architecture"><a class="header" href="#what-is-mach-architecture">What Is MACH Architecture?</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>MACH architecture</strong> is a software architecture that is composed of independent components, meaning it is built from smaller components that can be combined to form a complete system.</p>
<p>This composability allows software systems to be built from interchangeable parts that can be composed into various configurations. The advantage of this approach is that it allows different parts of the system to be continuously improved and optimized for specific purposes, which can lead to better performance and experience overall.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-and-advantages-of-mach-architecture"><a class="header" href="#what-are-the-benefits-and-advantages-of-mach-architecture">What Are the Benefits and Advantages of MACH Architecture?</a></h2>
<p>The advantages and benefits of MACH architecture include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>MACH architecture is a type of software architecture that is designed to be scalable. One of the benefits of this design is that it can easily be adapted to meet the changing needs of an organization.</p>
<p>For example, if an organization needs to grow, the MACH technologies can be scaled up to accommodate the additional load.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility and Composability (Tailor-Made Architecture )</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, MACH architecture is also designed to be flexible, meaning that it can be easily modified with the best-of-breed solutions to fit an organization’s specific requirements.</p>
<p>This flexibility makes MACH solutions ideal for organizations that need to respond to changes in their business environment rapidly.</p>
<p>As a result, the MACH technology stack provides organizations with a high degree of scalable and flexible enterprise technologies, making it a popular choice for many businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Future-Proof</strong></p>
<p>The need for faster and more efficient data and content processing will only grow as the world becomes increasingly digitized.</p>
<p>MACH ecosystem technologies are designed to meet this demand by providing a scalable and flexible architecture that can be easily adapted to changing needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MACH technology stack is also highly future-proof, meaning that it can be used for years to come without becoming outdated. This is due to its modular design, which allows new components to be added as needed.</p>
<p>As a result, businesses investing in MACH-first software can be confident that they are making a sound investment that will pay off for years.</p>
<p><strong>Faster Time to Market</strong></p>
<p>MACH architecture is a microservices-based approach that enables organizations to develop and deploy software faster.</p>
<p>By breaking down applications into small, independent services that can be developed and deployed independently, MACH reduces the time it takes to get new features and functionality to market.</p>
<p>In addition, because MACH services are loosely coupled, they are easier to change and update, reducing the risk of errors and making it easier to roll out new features and functionality quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>As a result, MACH can help organizations to achieve faster time-to-market, increased agility, and better overall software quality.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-about-mach-architecture"><a class="header" href="#challenges-about-mach-architecture">Challenges About MACH Architecture</a></h2>
<p>The MACH architecture has been widely increasing its adoption in recent years as a future-proof, high-performance alternative to traditional architectures. However, MACH architectures are not without their challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What you see is NOT what you get.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Coordination problems between software providers.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lack of collaboration between business and development teams.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="traditional-monolith-architecture-vs-mach-architecture"><a class="header" href="#traditional-monolith-architecture-vs-mach-architecture">Traditional (Monolith) Architecture vs. MACH Architecture</a></h2>
<p>Digital experience platforms are powerful tools to create, manage, and organize customer expectations. However, monolith architectures have some serious limitations in meeting evolving business requirements.</p>
<p>The problem is that most monolith architectures don’t offer the flexibility or features for the upcoming needs of business functionality. MACH architecture is a perfect solution for businesses looking to get the most out of their digital experience efforts.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-43.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h2 id="adoption-of-mach-architecture-and-mach-technologies"><a class="header" href="#adoption-of-mach-architecture-and-mach-technologies">Adoption of MACH Architecture and MACH Technologies</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://machalliance.org/insights/our-2022-research-shows-mach-adoption-is-high-on-the-agenda-for-tech-leaders">study</a>, published in March 2022, surveyed over 200 senior-level technology decision-makers from companies around the world to gauge awareness and adoption of MACH technology.</p>
<p>The findings of the ‘Enterprise MACHified’ are a strong indication that MACH is gaining momentum in the market and is poised to have a significant impact on the enterprise software landscape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision makers put a high value on offering superior CX quickly in the face of rapidly growing expectations.</li>
<li>The move to MACH is being driven by CX, market developments, and privacy/security concerns.</li>
<li>MACH’s motivations are closely connected to those who believe they are ahead of their competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s deep dive into this research to explore how top decision-makers for corporate organizations see MACH architecture:</p>
<p><strong>Decision makers see MACH as the future of architecture.</strong></p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-44.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p><strong>MACH intentions are strongly correlated with perceptions of outpacing competitors.</strong></p>
<p>75% of respondents think that they’re ahead of the competition — one-third believe their organization is significantly ahead of the competition, while two-fifths say they are slightly ahead of their competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Increased customer experience, faster adaptation, and improved privacy/security are driving reasons for the transition to MACH.</strong></p>
<p>The customer experience is the backbone of most businesses. Providing a great customer experience increases your customers’ likelihood to interact positively with you. For this reason, it’s a leading factor why increasing customer experience is one of the top reasons for switching to a MACH platform, with 60% ranking it as a number one priority.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-45.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>In today’s business world, change is the only constant. Markets shift and evolve at an ever-increasing pace, and businesses must be able to adapt just as quickly to stay competitive. That’s why responding to changes in the market faster (59%) and building and implementing new functionality quicker (54%) are other significant reasons for the transition to MACH.</p>
<p>Last but not least, improved privacy (56%) is another major reason for choosing MACH solutions over traditional ones.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to MACH are more likely to be around implementation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two-fifths (39%) of decision-makers said resistance to change from their development team is their main barrier to moving to a MACH-based infrastructure.</li>
<li>35% of companies rely more on their current vendors for business continuity, suggesting that existing B2B relationships impact business function.</li>
<li>A third (33%) are unclear about the trade-off between initial investment and long-term benefits.</li>
</ul>

<p>The MACH architecture provides a number of benefits that make it an attractive option for businesses. Perhaps most importantly, it is designed to be scalable, making it easy to add new applications without needing to reconfigure the entire system. This highly modular architecture allows businesses to customize their deployment to meet their specific needs.</p>
<p>When evaluating the MACH architecture, businesses should consider their specific needs and requirements. Here are a couple of questions you can ask when evaluating a potential MACH tool:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you add and replace services gradually over time?</li>
<li>Does it support adding or replacing best-of-breed systems and services independently?</li>
<li>Is it created using APIs from the ground up, or is an API built later?</li>
<li>Can you access technical documentation (demonstrating platform capabilities and resources) easily?</li>
<li>In terms of cloud infrastructure, does it have infinite scalability?</li>
<li>Do updates and upgrades take place through continuous delivery without causing any disruptions?</li>
<li>Can you freely and flexibly design and deploy the user experience?</li>
</ol>
<p>With MACH architecture, businesses can digitally transform and evolve with the future. This is an essential technology for any company that wants their business in line with new trends as they come about.</p>
<h1 id="is-mach-architecture-the-future-of-digital-customer-experience"><a class="header" href="#is-mach-architecture-the-future-of-digital-customer-experience">Is MACH Architecture the Future of Digital Customer Experience</a></h1>
<p>MACH is a new approach to digital customer experience that is gaining popularity among businesses.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional monolithic architectures, MACH separates each component of the customer experience into its own microservice that enables to use of full capabilities. This allows businesses to update their customer experience more quickly and easily without having to redeploy the entire system.</p>
<p>Additionally, MACH provides greater flexibility, capabilities, and scalability than monolithic architectures, making it well-suited for businesses that are growing quickly.</p>
<p>While MACH is still relatively new, it has already been adopted by some of the world’s leading companies and is widely considered to be the future of digital customer experience. As a result, it is not surprising that MACH architecture is quickly becoming the new standard for digital customer experience.</p>

Tools such as ADR (<em>Architecture Decision Record</em>) could be very usefull to maintain documentation up to date using a detailed methodology.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Base:</strong> Acts as a valuable knowledge repository for training and guiding new team members. This is a very important point. This kind of knowledge could be a great time saver and also prevent some technical debt from arising.</p>
<h1 id="trade-offs"><a class="header" href="#trade-offs">Trade-offs</a></h1>
<h2 id="complexity"><a class="header" href="#complexity">Complexity</a></h2>
<p><strong>Detail Overload:</strong> For large systems, capturing every detail can be overwhelming and may obscure the overall understanding. It can also be overkill for small systems.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Clarity Risk:</strong> Excessive focus on details can risk losing sight of the high-level strategic view. We all know the tendency we ( developers and architects ) have to over-engineer just because it is fun and satisfying.</p>
<h2 id="effort"><a class="header" href="#effort">Effort</a></h2>
<p><strong>Resource Demands:</strong> Requires significant time and effort to create and regularly update, demanding resources that could be allocated elsewhere. So the ROI has to be calculated, a project that is only short term or transitional should not require this kind of investment.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance Challenge:</strong> Keeping documentation current with system changes is a continuous and often resource-intensive task, so again focus on the ROI.</p>
<h2 id="detail-management"><a class="header" href="#detail-management">Detail Management</a></h2>
<p><strong>Balance Difficulty:</strong> Achieving the right level of detail without overcomplicating or oversimplifying is challenging. You need experienced resources, especially in architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Varied Needs:</strong> Tailoring documentation to meet different stakeholder needs without redundancy or confusion requires careful consideration. Again, you need to rely on an experienced architect who can guarantee this.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-3"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-3">Conclusion</a></h1>
<p>In conclusion, the structured approach of documenting and understanding software systems through Context, Containers, Components, and Code offers significant benefits. This multi-level perspective is crucial for a thorough understanding of the system, aiding in decision-making, stakeholder engagement and effective project management. It serves as a vital knowledge base and a standardized framework for discussions and alignment among various stakeholders.</p>
<p>However, these benefits come with trade-offs. The complexity of maintaining such detailed documentation can be overwhelming, especially for large or rapidly evolving systems. The effort required to create and update these models is substantial and demands significant resources. Additionally, managing the level of detail in documentation to cater to varied stakeholder needs without causing information overload or confusion presents an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>Therefore, while this approach is highly beneficial for understanding and communicating the architecture of software systems, it requires careful consideration and management to ensure that the documentation remains effective, relevant, and accessible to all stakeholders. Balancing the depth of detail with the high-level overview, and allocating resources efficiently for ongoing maintenance, are key to leveraging the full potential of this structured architectural approach.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-solution-architecture-1"><a class="header" href="#what-is-solution-architecture-1">What is Solution Architecture</a></h1>
<p>An informal introduction to Solution Architecture</p>
<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The term Solution Architecture refers to a high-level blueprint of a solution that was developed to solve one or more business problems within an enterprise using a technological approach. Building a proper solution architecture requires</p>
<ul>
<li>A good understanding of the business problem or problems (domain knowledge)</li>
<li>Comprehensive knowledge of the technologies used in the enterprise world (technical knowledge)</li>
<li>Experience in building similar solutions in the past (experience)</li>
</ul>
<p>A good solution architecture can be used to perform critical tasks such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing and implementing innovative solutions for the consumers of the business</li>
<li>Maintain excellent user experience with higher degrees of service availability</li>
<li>Perform calculations on return on investment (ROI) and total cost of ownership (TCO)</li>
</ul>
<p>Solution architecture tries to compact a gigantic set of details into a set of diagrams so that different stakeholders understand what is actually going on inside the enterprise software systems. It is helpful for highly technical people such as software developers, software architects, and CTOs as well we moderately technical people such as project managers, business analysts, and citizen developers.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-architectures-in-solution-architecture-1"><a class="header" href="#types-of-architectures-in-solution-architecture-1">Types of architectures in solution architecture</a></h2>
<p>The first step in solving any problem is understanding the business requirements of the client. To include all the critical information related to the business use case, we can come up with something called a “business architecture” which contains different types of applications, users, and their interactions at a very high level. We sometimes call this architecture “Level 0” architecture.</p>
<h3 id="business-architecture-level-0-architecture-1"><a class="header" href="#business-architecture-level-0-architecture-1">Business architecture (Level-0 architecture)</a></h3>
<p>The idea of business architecture is to come up with a possible solution to a real-world problem or problems and depict that in the form of a diagram or a document using the systems, applications, and users that are considered in the scenario with minimum technical details. This component is mainly useful for business executives and other non-technical stakeholders so that they can understand what technical solution is going to be built using this architecture. Given below is a “business architecture” diagram that we came up with for a mobile banking application.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-7.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Figure: The business architecture of a mobile banking application</p>
<p>The preceding figure depicts the various components associated with the solution in which we are building a mobile banking application for a given bank. It showcases the components such as gateway, integration, and security component as high-level building blocks to design a solution for this problem.</p>
<p>The next step in designing the solution architecture is to use this and design a technical architecture with the finer details about products and tools.</p>
<h3 id="technical-architecture-level-1-architecture-1"><a class="header" href="#technical-architecture-level-1-architecture-1">Technical architecture (Level-1 architecture)</a></h3>
<p>This is the type of diagram that includes details of specific vendors, products, and tools required to build a real-world software system using the business architecture blueprint. Coming up with a technical architecture requires the proper analysis of vendors and tools as well as the current and future business requirements and TCO/ROI calculations. The below diagram depicts a simplified version of a technical architecture for the business architecture we discussed before.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-6.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Figure: Technical architecture of a mobile banking solution</p>
<p>In this diagram, we have mentioned the specific vendors that we are going to use to fulfill the certain functionalities that we identified during the business architecture design phase. As an example, the diagram depicts that we are going to use the WSO2 API Manager solution as the API gateway which exposes the services to the mobile application. Similarly, it shows that we are going to use Mulesoft and Auth0 for respective functionalities. In addition to that, we can also depict information about which cloud platforms and container technologies we are going to use if we decided to go with a container-based solution.</p>
<p>Once the product vendors and tools are identified, the next step is to go further down into the actual deployment details and showcase the infrastructure level details that can be used by the developers as well as the operations teams to build the actual infrastructure for the solution.</p>
<h3 id="deployment-architecture-level-2-architecture-1"><a class="header" href="#deployment-architecture-level-2-architecture-1">Deployment architecture (Level-2 architecture)</a></h3>
<p>This architecture diagram showcases how the technical architecture looks like in a real computing infrastructure such as a data center or a cloud platform. It contains details on network-level segmentation, the number of replicas (instances), traffic routing components such as load balancers or firewalls, and many other details related to the actual deployment of the solution. The figure below depicts a simplified version of a deployment architecture that we can come up with for the mobile banking solution that we discussed before.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/Reference/image-5.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Figure: Deployment architecture for mobile banking solution</p>
<p>The preceding figure depicts the product versions, the number of replicas, and the deployment model of each component along with the traffic routing components (load balancers).</p>

Of the Fast Ethernet physical layers, 100BASE-TX is by far the most

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="5ess"><a class="header" href="#5ess">5ESS</a></h1>
<p>5ESS Switching System</p>
<p>The 5ESS Switching System is a telephone electronic switching system
developed by Western Electric for the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company (AT&amp;T) and the Bell System in the United States.</p>
<p>The 5ESS came to market as the Western Electric No. 5 ESS. It first
commenced service in Seneca, Illinois on 25 March 1982, and was destined
to replace the Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS and 1AESS)
and other electromechanical systems in the 1980s and 1990s. The 5ESS was
also used as a Class 4 telephone switch or as a hybrid Class 4/Class 5
switch in markets too small for the 4ESS. Approximately half of all US
central offices are served by 5ESS switches. The 5ESS is also exported
internationally, and manufactured outside the US under license.</p>
<p>The 5ESS technology was transferred to the AT&amp;T Network Systems division
upon the breakup of the Bell System. The division was divested by AT&amp;T
as Lucent Technologies, and after becoming Alcatel-Lucent, it was
acquired by Nokia.</p>
<p>The 5ESS switch has three main types of modules: the Administrative
Module (AM) contains the central computers; the Communications Module
(CM) is the central time-divided switch of the system; and the Switching
Module (SM) makes up the majority of the equipment in most exchanges.
The SM performs multiplexing, analog and digital coding, and other work
to interface with external equipment. Each has a controller, a small
computer with duplicated CPUs and memories, like most common equipment
of the exchange, for redundancy. Distributed systems lessen the load on
the Central Administrative Module (AM) or main computer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="5g"><a class="header" href="#5g">5G</a></h1>
<p>5G is a marketing term for some new mobile technologies. Definitions
differ and confusion is common. The ITU IMT-2020 standard provides for
speeds up to 20 gigabits per second and has only been demonstrated with
millimeter waves of 15 gigahertz and higher frequency. The more recent
3GPP standard includes any network using the NR New Radio software. 5G
New Radio can include lower frequencies, from 600 MHz to 6 GHz. However,
the speeds in these lower frequencies are only modestly higher than new
4G systems, estimated at 15% to 50% faster. At least at the lower
frequencies, &quot;5G is evolutionary.&quot;</p>

<p>EEE 802.11 is part of the IEEE 802 set of local area network (LAN)
technical standards, and specifies the set of media access control (MAC)
and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless local area
network (WLAN) computer communication. The standard and amendments
provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand
and are the world's most widely used wireless computer networking
standards. IEEE 802.11 is used in most home and office networks to allow
laptops, printers, smartphones, and other devices to communicate with
each other and access the Internet without connecting wires.</p>
<p>The standards are created and maintained by the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802).
The base version of the standard was released in 1997 and has had
subsequent amendments. While each amendment is officially revoked when
it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate
world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote the
capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each
revision tends to become its own standard.</p>
<p>IEEE 802.11 uses various frequencies including, but not limited to, 2.4
GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, and 60 GHz frequency bands. Although IEEE 802.11
specifications list channels that might be used, the radio frequency
spectrum availability allowed varies significantly by regulatory domain.</p>
<p>The protocols are typically used in conjunction with IEEE 802.2, and are
designed to interwork seamlessly with Ethernet, and are very often used
to carry Internet Protocol traffic.</p>

<p>Advanced Audio Coding</p>
<p>Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a proprietary audio coding standard for
lossy digital audio compression. Designed to be the successor of the MP3
format, AAC generally achieves better sound quality than MP3 at the same
bit rate. The confusingly named AAC+ (HE-AAC) does so only at low bit
rates and less so at high ones.</p>
<p>AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC, as part of the MPEG-2 and
MPEG-4 specifications. Part of AAC, HE-AAC (AAC+), is part of MPEG-4
Audio and also adopted into digital radio standards DAB+ and Digital
Radio Mondiale, as well as mobile television standards DVB-H and
ATSC-M/H.</p>
<p>AAC supports inclusion of 48 full-bandwidth (up to 96 kHz) audio
channels in one stream plus 16 low frequency effects (LFE, limited to
120 Hz) channels, up to 16 &quot;coupling&quot; or dialog channels, and up to 16
data streams. The quality for stereo is satisfactory to modest
requirements at 96 kbit/s in joint stereo mode; however, hi-fi
transparency demands data rates of at least 128 kbit/s (VBR). Tests of
MPEG-4 audio have shown that AAC meets the requirements referred to as
&quot;transparent&quot; for the ITU at 128 kbit/s for stereo, and 320 kbit/s for
5.1 audio.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aal1"><a class="header" href="#aal1">AAL1</a></h1>
<p>An ATM Adaptation layer 1 or AAL1 is used for transmitting Class A
network traffic, that is, real-time, constant bit rate, connection
oriented traffic (example- uncompressed audio and video). Bits are fed
in by the application at constant rate and must be delivered to other
end with minimum delay, jitter or overhead. The input is stream of bits
without message boundaries. For this traffic, error detection protocols
cannot be used since timeouts and retransmission causes delay but the
missing cells are reported to the application, that must take its own
action to recover from them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aal2"><a class="header" href="#aal2">AAL2</a></h1>
<p>ATM Adaptation Layer 2</p>
<p>ATM Adaptation Layer 2 (AAL2) is an ATM adaptation layer for
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), used primarily in telecommunications;
for example, it is used for the Iu interfaces in the Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System, and is also used for transporting digital
voice. The standard specifications related to AAL2 are ITU standards
I.363.2 and I366.1.</p>
<p>What is AAL2?<br />
AAL2 is a variable bitrate, connection-oriented, low latency service
originally intended to adapt voice for transmission over ATM. Like other
ATM adaptation layers, AAL2 defines segmentation and reassembly of
higher-layer packets into ATM cells, in this case packets of data
containing voice and control information. AAL2 is further separated into
two sub-layers that help with the mapping from upper layer services to
ATM cells. These are named Service Specific Convergence Sub-layer (SSCS)
and Common Part Sub-layer (CPS).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aal5"><a class="header" href="#aal5">AAL5</a></h1>
<p>ATM Adaptation Layer 5</p>
<p>ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) is an ATM adaptation layer used to send
variable-length packets up to 65,535 octets in size across an
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network.</p>
<p>Unlike most network frames, which place control information in the
header, AAL5 places control information in an 8-octet trailer at the end
of the packet. The AAL5 trailer contains a 16-bit length field, a 32-bit
cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and two 8-bit fields labeled UU and CPI
that are currently unused.</p>
<p>Each AAL5 packet is divided into an integral number of ATM cells and
reassembled into a packet before delivery to the receiving host. This
process is known as Segmentation and Reassembly (see below). The last
cell contains padding to ensure that the entire packet is a multiple of
48 octets long. The final cell contains up to 40 octets of data,
followed by padding bytes and the 8-octet trailer. In other words, AAL5
places the trailer in the last 8 octets of the final cell where it can
be found without knowing the length of the packet; the final cell is
identified by a bit in the ATM header (see below), and the trailer is
always in the last 8 octets of that cell.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ad"><a class="header" href="#ad">AD</a></h1>
<p>Active Directory</p>
<p>Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed
for the Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server
operating systems as a set of processes and services. Initially, Active
Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management. Starting
with Windows Server 2008, however, Active Directory became an umbrella
title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.</p>
<p>A server running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is called a
domain controller. It authenticates and authorizes all users and
computers in a Windows domain type network---assigning and enforcing
security policies for all computers and installing or updating software.
For example, when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows
domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines
whether the user is a system administrator or normal user. Also, it
allows management and storage of information, provides authentication
and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy
other related services: Certificate Services, Federated Services,
Lightweight Directory Services and Rights Management Services.</p>
<p>Active Directory uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version of Kerberos, and DNS.</p>

<p>Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop</p>
<p>Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) is a type of digital
subscriber line (DSL) technology, a data communications technology that
enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a
conventional voiceband modem can provide. ADSL differs from the less
common symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL). In ADSL, bandwidth and
bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer
premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). Providers usually
market ADSL as a service for consumers for Internet access for primarily
downloading content from the Internet, but not serving content accessed
by others.<br />

<p>Advanced Encryption Standard</p>
<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name
Rijndael is a specification for the encryption of electronic data
established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in 2001.</p>
<p>AES is a subset of the Rijndael block cipher developed by two Belgian
cryptographers, Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen, who submitted a
proposal[5] to NIST during the AES selection process.[6] Rijndael is
a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes.</p>
<p>For AES, NIST selected three members of the Rijndael family, each with a
block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192 and
256 bits.</p>
<p>AES has been adopted by the U.S. government and is now used worldwide.
It supersedes the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was published in
1977. The algorithm described by AES is a symmetric-key algorithm,
meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the
data.</p>
<p>In the United States, AES was announced by the NIST as U.S. FIPS PUB 197
(FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001. This announcement followed a five-year
standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were
presented and evaluated, before the Rijndael cipher was selected as the
most suitable (see Advanced Encryption Standard process for more
details).</p>
<p>AES became effective as a federal government standard on May 26, 2002,
after approval by the Secretary of Commerce. AES is included in the
ISO/IEC 18033-3 standard. AES is available in many different encryption
packages, and is the first (and only) publicly accessible cipher
approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for top secret
information when used in an NSA approved cryptographic module</p>

data and framing pattern) is a signal transmitted by an intermediate
element of a multi-node transport circuit that is part of a concatenated
telecommunications system to alert the receiving end of the circuit that
a segment of the end-to-end link has failed at a logical or physical
level, even if the system it is directly connected to is still working.
The AIS replaces the failed data, allowing the higher order system in
the concatenation to maintain its transmission framing integrity.
Downstream intermediate elements of the transport circuit propagate the
AIS onwards to the destination element.</p>

<p>Access Link Control Application Protocol</p>
<p>Control plane protocol for the transport layer in 3rd Generation UMTS
networks is called ALCAP (&quot;Access Link Control Application Part&quot;). ALCAP
is defined by 3GPP as equivalent of ITU recommendation Q.2630.2. Basic
functionality of ALCAP is multiplexing of different users onto one AAL2
transmission path using channel IDs (CIDs). It is used in the UMTS
access network UTRAN along with ATM, while IPBCP is use for IP links in
the core of the network.</p>
<p>ALCAP makes it possible for up to 248 channels to be multiplexed onto
one AAL2 bearer.</p>

<p>Asymmetric Multiprocessing</p>
<p>In an asymmetric multiprocessing system (AMP), not all CPUs are treated
equally; for example, a system might allow (either at the hardware or
operating system level) only one CPU to execute operating system code or
might allow only one CPU to perform I/O operations. Other AMP systems
would allow any CPU to execute operating system code and perform I/O
operations, so that they were symmetric with regard to processor roles,
but attached some or all peripherals to particular CPUs, so that they
were asymmetric with respect to the peripheral attachment. Asymmetric
multiprocessing was the only method for handling multiple CPUs before
symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) was available. It has also been used to
provide less expensive options on systems where SMP was available.
Additionally, AMP is used in applications that are dedicated, such as
embedded systems, when individual processors can be dedicated to
specific tasks at design time.</p>
<p>Multiprocessing is the use of more than one CPU in a computer system.
The CPU is the arithmetic and logic engine that executes user
applications. With multiple CPUs, more than one set of program
instructions can be executed at the same time. All of the CPUs have the
same user-mode instruction set, so a running job can be rescheduled from
one CPU to another.</p>

<p>Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrow band</p>
<p>The Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR, AMR-NB or GSM-AMR) audio codec is an audio
compression format optimized for speech coding. AMR speech codec
consists of a multi-rate narrowband speech codec that encodes narrowband
(200--3400 Hz) signals at variable bit rates ranging from 4.75 to 12.2
kbit/s with toll quality speech starting at 7.4 kbit/s.</p>
<p>AMR was adopted as the standard speech codec by 3GPP in October 1999 and
is now widely used in GSM[4] and UMTS. It uses link adaptation to
select from one of eight different bit rates based on link conditions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="amr-wb"><a class="header" href="#amr-wb">AMR-WB</a></h1>
<p>Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband</p>
<p>Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) is a patented wideband speech
audio coding standard developed based on Adaptive Multi-Rate encoding,
using similar methodology as algebraic code excited linear prediction
(ACELP). AMR-WB provides improved speech quality due to a wider speech
bandwidth of 50--7000 Hz compared to narrowband speech coders which in
general are optimized for POTS wireline quality of 300--3400 Hz. AMR-WB
was developed by Nokia and VoiceAge and it was first specified by 3GPP.</p>
<p>AMR-WB is codified as G.722.2, an ITU-T standard speech codec, formally
known as Wideband coding of speech at around 16 kbit/s using Adaptive
Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB). G.722.2 AMR-WB is the same codec as the
3GPP AMR-WB. The corresponding 3GPP specifications are TS 26.190 for the
speech codec and TS 26.194 for the Voice Activity Detector.</p>
<p>The AMR-WB format has the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency bands processed: 50-6400 Hz (all modes) plus 6400-7000 Hz
(23.85 kbit/s mode only)</li>
<li>Delay frame size: 20 ms</li>
<li>Look ahead: 5 ms</li>
<li>AMR-WB codec employs a bandsplitting filter; the one-way delay of
this filter is 0.9375 ms</li>
<li>Complexity: 38 WMOPS, RAM 5.3KWords</li>
<li>Voice activity detection, discontinuous transmission, comfort noise

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aop"><a class="header" href="#aop">AOP</a></h1>
<p>aspect-oriented programming</p>
<p>In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming
paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of
cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to
existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead
separately specifying which code is modified via a &quot;pointcut&quot;
specification, such as &quot;log all function calls when the function's name
begins with 'set'&quot;. This allows behaviors that are not central to the
business logic (such as logging) to be added to a program without
cluttering the code, core to the functionality. AOP forms a basis for
aspect-oriented software development.</p>
<p>AOP includes programming methods and tools that support the
modularization of concerns at the level of the source code, while
&quot;aspect-oriented software development&quot; refers to a whole engineering
discipline.</p>
<p>Aspect-oriented programming entails breaking down program logic into
distinct parts (so-called concerns, cohesive areas of functionality).
Nearly all programming paradigms support some level of grouping and
encapsulation of concerns into separate, independent entities by
providing abstractions (e.g., functions, procedures, modules, classes,
methods) that can be used for implementing, abstracting and composing
these concerns. Some concerns &quot;cut across&quot; multiple abstractions in a
program, and defy these forms of implementation. These concerns are
called cross-cutting concerns or horizontal concerns.</p>
<p>Logging exemplifies a crosscutting concern because a logging strategy
necessarily affects every logged part of the system. Logging thereby
crosscuts all logged classes and methods.</p>
<p>All AOP implementations have some crosscutting expressions that
encapsulate each concern in one place. The difference between
implementations lies in the power, safety, and usability of the
constructs provided. For example, interceptors that specify the methods
to intercept express a limited form of crosscutting, without much
support for type-safety or debugging. AspectJ has a number of such
expressions and encapsulates them in a special class, an aspect. For
example, an aspect can alter the behavior of the base code (the
non-aspect part of a program) by applying advice (additional behavior)
at various join points (points in a program) specified in a
quantification or query called a pointcut (that detects whether a given
join point matches). An aspect can also make binary-compatible
structural changes to other classes, like adding members or parents.</p>

<p>Access Point Name</p>
<p>An Access Point Name (APN) is the name of a gateway between a GSM, GPRS,
3G or 4G mobile network and another computer network, frequently the
public Internet.</p>
<p>A mobile device making a data connection must be configured with an APN
to present to the carrier. The carrier will then examine this identifier
to determine what type of network connection should be created, for
example: which IP addresses should be assigned to the wireless device,
which security methods should be used, and how or if, it should be
connected to some private customer network.</p>
<p>More specifically, the APN identifies the packet data network (PDN) that
a mobile data user wants to communicate with. In addition to identifying
a PDN, an APN may also be used to define the type of service,
(e.g. connection to Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) server,
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)) that is provided by the PDN. APN is
used in 3GPP data access networks, e.g. General Packet Radio Service
(GPRS), evolved packet core (EPC).</p>

<p>In computer networking, ARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, or ARP poison
routing, is a technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network. Generally,
the aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address
of another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant
for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.</p>
<p>ARP spoofing may allow an attacker to intercept data frames on a
network, modify the traffic, or stop all traffic. Often the attack is
used as an opening for other attacks, such as denial of service, man in
the middle, or session hijacking attacks.</p>
<p>The attack can only be used on networks that use ARP, and requires
attacker have direct access to the local network segment to be attacked<br />

<p>Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is an interface description
language for defining data structures that can be serialized and

telecommunications and computer networking, and especially in
cryptography.</p>
<p>Protocol developers define data structures in ASN.1 modules, which are
generally a section of a broader standards document written in the ASN.1
language. Because the language is both human-readable and
machine-readable, modules can be automatically turned into libraries
that process their data structures, using an ASN.1 compiler.</p>
<p>ASN.1 is similar in purpose and use to protocol buffers and Apache
Thrift, which are also interface description
languages for cross-platform data serialization. Like those languages,
it has a schema (in ASN.1, called a &quot;module&quot;), and a set of encodings,
typically type-length-value encodings. However, ASN.1, defined in 1984,
predates them by many years. It also includes a wider variety of basic
data types, some of which are obsolete, and has more
options for extensibility. A single ASN.1 message can include data from
multiple modules defined in multiple standards, even standards defined

voice, data, and video signals&quot;.[1] ATM was developed to meet the
needs of the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network, as defined

networks. Additionally, It was designed for networks that must handle
both traditional high-throughput data traffic (e.g., file transfers),
and real-time, low-latency content such as voice and video. The
reference model for ATM approximately maps to the three lowest layers of
the ISO-OSI reference model: network layer, data link layer, and
physical layer.[3] ATM is a core protocol used over the SONET/SDH
backbone of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN), but its use is declining in favour of
all IP.<br />

<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides
on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and
governments, on a paid subscription basis. The technology allows
subscribers to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers,
available all the time, through the Internet. AWS's version of virtual
computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer including
hardware (CPU(s) &amp; GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory,
hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and
pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM,
etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O (keyboard,
display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS
system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window into the
virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their
virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can
choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services
for themselves and their customers.</p>
<p>The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world,
and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination
of usage, the hardware/OS/software/networking features chosen by the
subscriber, required availability, redundancy, security, and service
options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a
dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. As part of the
subscription agreement, Amazon provides security for subscribers'
system. AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6

<p>An audio coding format (or sometimes audio compression format) is a
content representation format for storage or transmission of digital
audio (such as in digital television, digital radio and in audio and
video files). Examples of audio coding formats include MP3, AAC, Vorbis,
FLAC, and Opus. A specific software or hardware implementation capable
of audio compression and decompression to/from a specific audio coding
format is called an audio codec; an example of an audio codec is LAME,
which is one of several different codecs which implements encoding and
decoding audio in the MP3 audio coding format in software.</p>
<p>Some audio coding formats are documented by a detailed technical
specification document known as an audio coding specification. Some such
specifications are written and approved by standardization organizations
as technical standards, and are thus known as an audio coding standard.
The term &quot;standard&quot; is also sometimes used for de facto standards as
well as formal standards.</p>
<p>Audio content encoded in a particular audio coding format is normally
encapsulated within a container format. As such, the user normally
doesn't have a raw AAC file, but instead has a .m4a audio file, which is
a MPEG-4 Part 14 container containing AAC-encoded audio. The container
also contains metadata such as title and other tags, and perhaps an
index for fast seeking. A notable exception is MP3 files, which are raw
audio coding without a container format. De facto standards for adding
metadata tags such as title and artist to MP3s, such as ID3, are hacks
which work by appending the tags to the MP3, and then relying on the MP3
player to recognize the chunk as malformed audio coding and therefore
skip it. In video files with audio, the encoded audio content is bundled
with video (in a video coding format) inside a multimedia container
format.</p>
<p>An audio coding format does not dictate all algorithms used by a codec
implementing the format. An important part of how lossy audio
compression works is by removing data in ways humans can't hear,
according to a psychoacoustic model; the implementer of an encoder has
some freedom of choice in which data to remove (according to their
psychoacoustic model).<br />

<p>business-to-business</p>
<p>Business-to-business (B2B or, in some countries, BtoB) refers to a
situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with
another. This typically occurs when:</p>
<p>A business is sourcing materials for their production process (e.g. a
food manufacturer purchasing salt).<br />
A business needs the services of another for operational reasons (e.g. a
food manufacturer employing an accountancy firm to audit their
finances).<br />
A business re-sells goods and services produced by others (e.g. a
retailer buying the end product from the food manufacturer).<br />
B2B is often contrasted with business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B
commerce, it is often the case that the parties to the relationship have
comparable negotiating power, and even when they do not, each party
typically involves professional staff and legal counsel in the
negotiation of terms, whereas B2C is shaped to a far greater degree by
economic implications of information asymmetry. However, within a B2B
context, large companies may have many commercial, resource and
information advantages over smaller businesses.</p>

<p>business-to-consumer</p>
<p>Business to consumer (B2C) refers to the transactions conducted directly
between a company and consumers who are the end-users of its products or
services. The business to consumer as a business model differs
significantly from the business-to-business model, which refers to
commerce between two or more businesses. While most companies that sell
directly to consumers can be referred to as B2C companies, the term
became immensely popular during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when
it was used mainly to refer to online retailers, as well as other
companies that sold products and services to consumers through the
internet.</p>

<p>BASIC (an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)
is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose

Thomas E. Kurtz and Sr. Mary Kenneth Keller designed the original BASIC
language at Dartmouth College. They wanted to enable students in fields
other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly
all use of computers required writing custom software, which was

<p>Basic Encoding Rules</p>
<p>The format for Basic Encoding Rules specifies a self-describing and
self-delimiting format for encoding ASN.1 data structures. Each data
element is encoded as a type identifier, a length description, the
actual data elements, and, where necessary, an end-of-content marker.
These types of encodings are commonly called type-length-value or TLV
encodings. This format allows a receiver to decode the ASN.1 information
from an incomplete stream, without requiring any pre-knowledge of the
size, content, or semantic meaning of the data.</p>

<p>Broadband Network Gateway</p>
<p>The Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) allows subscribers to connect to a

Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Network Service Provider (NSP).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bootp"><a class="header" href="#bootp">BOOTP</a></h1>
<p>Dynamic IP Address Allocation -- Bootstrap protocol</p>
<p>The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a computer networking protocol used in
Internet Protocol networks to automatically assign an IP address to
network devices from a configuration server. The BOOTP was originally
defined in RFC 951.</p>
<p>When a computer that is connected to a network is powered up and boots
its operating system, the system software broadcasts BOOTP messages onto
the network to request an IP address assignment. A BOOTP configuration
server assigns an IP address based on the request from a pool of
addresses configured by an administrator.</p>
<p>BOOTP is implemented using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as transport
protocol, port number 67 is used by the (DHCP) server to receive client
requests and port number 68 is used by the client to receive (DHCP)
server responses. BOOTP operates only on IPv4 networks.</p>
<p>Historically, BOOTP has also been used for Unix-like diskless
workstations to obtain the network location of their boot image, in
addition to the IP address assignment. Enterprises used it to roll out a
pre-configured client (e.g., Windows) installation to newly installed
PCs.</p>

<p>Business Process Execution Language</p>
<p>BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) is an XML-based language that
allows Web services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA) to
interconnect and share data.</p>
<p>Programmers use BPEL to define how a business process that involves web
services will be executed. BPEL messages are typically used to invoke
remote services, orchestrate process execution and manage events and
exceptions.</p>
<p>BPEL is often associated with Business Process Management Notation
(BPMN), a standard for representing business processes graphically. In
many organizations, analysts use BPMN to visualize business processes
and developers transform the visualizations to BPEL for execution.</p>
<p>BPEL was standardized by OASIS in 2004 after collaborative efforts to

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bsc"><a class="header" href="#bsc">BSC</a></h1>
<p>The base station controller (BSC) provides, classically, the
intelligence behind the BTSs. Typically a BSC has tens or even hundreds
of BTSs under its control. The BSC handles allocation of radio channels,
receives measurements from the mobile phones, and controls handovers
from BTS to BTS (except in the case of an inter-BSC handover in which
case control is in part the responsibility of the anchor MSC). A key
function of the BSC is to act as a concentrator where many different low
capacity connections to BTSs (with relatively low utilisation) become
reduced to a smaller number of connections towards the mobile switching
center (MSC) (with a high level of utilisation). Overall, this means
that networks are often structured to have many BSCs distributed into
regions near their BTSs which are then connected to large centralised
MSC sites.</p>
<p>The BSC is undoubtedly the most robust element in the BSS as it is not
only a BTS controller but, for some vendors, a full switching center, as
well as an SS7 node with connections to the MSC and serving GPRS support
node (SGSN) (when using GPRS). It also provides all the required data to
the operation support subsystem (OSS) as well as to the performance
measuring centers.</p>
<p>A BSC is often based on a distributed computing architecture, with
redundancy applied to critical functional units to ensure availability
in the event of fault conditions. Redundancy often extends beyond the
BSC equipment itself and is commonly used in the power supplies and in
the transmission equipment providing the A-ter interface to PCU.<br />

<p>In a hierarchical telecommunications network the backhaul portion of the
network comprises the intermediate links between the core network, or
backbone network, and the small subnetworks at the &quot;edge&quot; of the entire
hierarchical network.</p>
<p>In contracts pertaining to such networks, backhaul is the obligation to
carry packets to and from that global network. A non-technical business
definition of backhaul is the commercial wholesale bandwidth provider
who offers quality of service (QOS) guarantees to the retailer. It
appears most often in telecommunications trade literature in this sense,
whereby the backhaul connection is defined not technically but by who
operates and manages it, and who takes legal responsibility for the
connection or uptime to the Internet or 3G/4G network. See also hotspot
contracts below.</p>
<p>In both the technical and commercial definitions, backhaul generally
refers to the side of the network that communicates with the global
Internet, paid for at wholesale commercial access rates to or at an
Ethernet Exchange or other core network access location. Sometimes
middle mile networks exist between the customer's own LAN and those
exchanges. This can be a local WAN or WLAN connection, for instance
Network New Hampshire Now and Maine Fiber Company run tariffed public
dark fiber networks as a backhaul alternative to encourage local and
national carriers to reach areas with broadband and cell phone that they
otherwise would not be serving. These serve retail networks which in

<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language,
supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion,
while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By
design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine
instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications
that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating
systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging
from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
<p>C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at
Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has
since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all
time, with C compilers from various vendors available for the
majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has
been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
<p>C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled
using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access
to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to
machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite
its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage
cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C
program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms
and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language
has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded
microcontrollers to supercomputers.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="c-2"><a class="header" href="#c-2">C++</a></h1>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative,
object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing
facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
<p>It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded,
resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and
flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found
useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software
infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop
applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL servers), and
performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space
probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it
available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers,
including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.</p>
<p>C++ is standardized by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version
ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017
(informally known as C+17). The C+ programming language was initially
standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by
the C+03, C11 and C14 standards. The current C17 standard supersedes
these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the
initial standardization in 1998, C+ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup
at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he wanted
an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided
high-level features for program organization. C++20 is the next planned
standard thereafter.</p>

<p>Certificate Authority</p>
<p>In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA)
is an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate
certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the
certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon
signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds
to the certified public key. A CA acts as a trusted third
party---trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by
the party relying upon the certificate. The format of these certificates
is specified by the X.509 standard.</p>
<p>One particularly common use for certificate authorities is to sign
certificates used in HTTPS, the secure browsing protocol for the World
Wide Web. Another common use is in issuing identity cards by national
governments for use in electronically signing documents.</p>

<p>Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic</p>
<p>Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) is a
set of standards designed to work on either a GSM core network or the
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network. The framework
provides tools for operators to define additional features for standard
GSM services/UMTS services. The CAMEL architecture is based on the
Intelligent Network (IN) standards, and uses the CAP protocol. The
protocols are codified in a series of ETSI Technical Specifications.</p>
<p>Many services can be created using CAMEL, and it is particularly
effective in allowing these services to be offered when a subscriber is
roaming, like, for instance, no-prefix dialing (the number the user
dials is the same no matter the country where the call is placed) or
seamless MMS message access from abroad.</p>

<p>CAMEL Application Part</p>
<p>The CAMEL Application Part (CAP) is a signalling protocol used in the
Intelligent Network (IN) architecture. CAP is a Remote Operations
Service Element (ROSE) user protocol, and as such is layered on top of
the Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) of the SS#7
protocol suite. CAP is based on a subset of the ETSI Core and allows for
the implementation of carrier-grade, value added services such as
unified messaging, prepaid, fraud control and Freephone in both the GSM
voice and GPRS data networks. CAMEL is a means of adding intelligent
applications to mobile (rather than fixed) networks. It builds upon
established practices in the fixed line telephony business that are
generally classed under the heading of (Intelligent Network Application
Part) or INAP CS-2 protocol</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ccs"><a class="header" href="#ccs">CCS</a></h1>
<p>Common Channel Signalling</p>
<p>In telephony, common-channel signaling (CCS), in the US also
common-channel interoffice signaling (CCIS), is the transmission of
signaling information (control information) on a separate channel than
the data, and, more specifically, where that signaling channel controls
multiple data channels.</p>
<p>For example, in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) one channel
of a communications link is typically used for the sole purpose of
carrying signaling for establishment and tear down of telephone calls.
The remaining channels are used entirely for the transmission of voice
data. In most cases, a single 64kbit/s channel is sufficient to handle
the call setup and call clear-down traffic for numerous voice and data
channels.</p>
<p>The logical alternative to CCS is channel-associated signaling (CAS), in
which each bearer channel has a signaling channel dedicated to it.</p>
<p>CCS offers the following advantages over CAS, in the context of the
PSTN:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Faster call set-up time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater trunking efficiency due to the quicker set up and clearing,
thereby reducing traffic on the network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can transfer additional information along with the signaling
traffic, providing features such as caller ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signaling can be performed mid-call</p>
<p>The most common CCS signaling methods in use today are Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Signalling System No. 7 (SS7).</p>
<p>ISDN signaling is used primarily on trunks connecting end-user
private branch exchange (PBX) systems to a central office. SS7 is
primarily used within the PSTN. The two signaling methods are very
similar since they share a common heritage and in some cases, the
same signaling messages are transmitted in both ISDN and SS7.</p>

<p>Code-division multiple access</p>
<p>Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method used by
various radio communication technologies.</p>
<p>CDMA is an example of multiple access, where several transmitters can
send information simultaneously over a single communication channel.
This allows several users to share a band of frequencies . To permit
this without undue interference between the users, CDMA employs spread
spectrum technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter
is assigned a code).</p>
<p>CDMA is used as the access method in many mobile phone standards. IS-95,
also called &quot;cdmaOne&quot;, and its 3G evolution CDMA2000, are often simply
referred to as &quot;CDMA&quot;, but UMTS, the 3G standard used by GSM carriers,
also uses &quot;wideband CDMA&quot;, or W-CDMA, as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA,
as its radio technologies.</p>

<p>Comfort Noise Generation</p>
<p>Comfort noise (or comfort tone) is synthetic background noise used in
radio and wireless communications to fill the artificial silence in a
transmission resulting from voice activity detection or from the audio
clarity of modern digital lines.</p>
<p>Some modern telephone systems (such as wireless and VoIP) use voice
activity detection (VAD), a form of squelching where low volume levels
are ignored by the transmitting device. In digital audio transmissions,
this saves bandwidth of the communications channel by transmitting
nothing when the source volume is under a certain threshold, leaving
only louder sounds (such as the speaker's voice) to be sent. However,
improvements in background noise reduction technologies can occasionally
result in the complete removal of all noise. Although maximizing call
quality is of primary importance, exhaustive removal of noise may not
properly simulate the typical behavior of terminals on the PSTN system.</p>
<p>The result of receiving total silence, especially for a prolonged
period, has a number of unwanted effects on the listener, including the
following:</p>
<p>the listener may believe that the transmission has been lost, and
therefore hang up prematurely.<br />
the speech may sound &quot;choppy&quot; (see noise gate) and difficult to
understand.<br />
the sudden change in sound level can be jarring to the listener.<br />
To counteract these effects, comfort noise is added, usually on the
receiving end in wireless or VoIP systems, to fill in the silent
portions of transmissions with artificial noise. The noise generated is
at a low but audible volume level, and can vary based on the average
volume level of received signals to minimize jarring transitions.</p>
<p>In many VoIP products, users may control how VAD and comfort noise are
configured, or disable the feature entirely.</p>
<p>As part of the RTP audio video profile, RFC 3389 defines a standard for
distributing comfort noise information in VoIP systems.</p>
<p>A similar concept is that of sidetone, the effect of sound that is
picked up by a telephone's mouthpiece and introduced (at low level) into
the earpiece of the same handset, acting as feedback.</p>

than the commissioning of custom-made, or bespoke, solutions. A related
term, Mil-COTS, refers to COTS products for use by the U.S. military.</p>
<p>In the context of the U.S. government, the Federal Acquisition

items, including services, available in the commercial marketplace that
can be bought and used under government contract. For example, Microsoft
is a COTS software provider. Goods and construction materials may
qualify as COTS but bulk cargo does not. Services associated with the
commercial items may also qualify as COTS, including installation
services, training services, and cloud services.</p>
<p>COTS purchases are alternatives to custom software or one-off
developments -- government-funded developments or otherwise.</p>
<p>Although COTS products can be used out of the box, in practice the COTS
product must be configured to achieve the needs of the business and
integrated to existing organizational systems. Extending the
functionality of COTS products via custom development is also an option,
however this decision should be carefully considered due to the long

contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event
the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against
data corruption. CRCs can be used for error correction (see bitfilters).</p>
<p>CRCs are so called because the check (data verification) value is a
redundancy (it expands the message without adding information) and the
algorithm is based on cyclic codes. CRCs are popular because they are
simple to implement in binary hardware, easy to analyze mathematically,
and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by noise in
transmission channels. Because the check value has a fixed length, the
function that generates it is occasionally used as a hash function.</p>

<p>Call Session Control Function</p>
<p>Several roles of SIP servers or proxies, collectively called Call
Session Control Function (CSCF), are used to process SIP signaling
packets in the IMS.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is a SIP proxy that is the first point of
contact for the IMS terminal. It can be located either in the
visited network (in full IMS networks) or in the home network (when
the visited network is not IMS compliant yet). Some networks may use
a Session Border Controller (SBC) for this function. The P-CSCF is
at its core a specialized SBC for the User--network interface which
not only protects the network, but also the IMS terminal. The use of
an additional SBC between the IMS terminal and the P-CSCF is
unnecessary and infeasible due to the signaling being encrypted on
this leg. The terminal discovers its P-CSCF with either DHCP, or it
may be configured (e.g. during initial provisioning or via a 3GPP
IMS Management Object (MO)) or in the ISIM or assigned in the PDP
Context (in General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Interrogating-CSCF (I-CSCF) is another SIP function located at
the edge of an administrative domain. Its IP address is published in
the Domain Name System (DNS) of the domain (using NAPTR and SRV type
of DNS records), so that remote servers can find it, and use it as a
forwarding point (e.g., registering) for SIP packets to this domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Serving-CSCF (S-CSCF) is the central node of the signaling plane.
It is a SIP server, but performs session control too. It is always
located in the home network. It uses Diameter Cx and Dx interfaces
to the HSS to download user profiles and upload user-to-S-CSCF
associations (the user profile is only cached locally for processing
reasons and is not changed). All necessary subscriber profile

<p>Customer Site Interconnect</p>
<p>In telecommunications, interconnection is the physical linking of a
carrier's network with equipment or facilities not belonging to that
network. The term may refer to a connection between a carrier's
facilities and the equipment belonging to its customer, or to a
connection between two (or more) carriers.<br />

<p>Carrier-sense multiple access</p>
<p>Carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) is a media access control (MAC)
protocol in which a node verifies the absence of other traffic before
transmitting on a shared transmission medium, such as an electrical bus
or a band of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>A transmitter attempts to determine whether another transmission is in
progress before initiating a transmission using a carrier-sense
mechanism. That is, it tries to detect the presence of a carrier signal
from another node before attempting to transmit. If a carrier is sensed,
the node waits for the transmission in progress to end before initiating
its own transmission. Using CSMA, multiple nodes may, in turn, send and
receive on the same medium. Transmissions by one node are generally
received by all other nodes connected to the medium.</p>
<p>Variations on basic CSMA include addition of collision-avoidance,
collision-detection and collision-resolution techniques.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="css"><a class="header" href="#css">CSS</a></h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and
reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
<p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has
rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
device.</p>
<p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>
<p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use
with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
validation service for CSS documents.</p>
<p>In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS,
including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cue"><a class="header" href="#cue">CUE</a></h1>
<p>Configure Unify Execute</p>
<p>CUE is an open-source data validation language and inference engine with its roots in logic programming. Although the language is not a general-purpose programming language, it has many applications, such as data validation, data templating, configuration, querying, code generation and even scripting. The inference engine can be used to validate data in code or to include it as part of a code generation pipeline.</p>
<p>A key thing that sets CUE apart from its peer languages is that it merges types and values into a single concept. Whereas in most languages types and values are strictly distinct, CUE orders them in a single hierarchy (a lattice, to be precise). This is a very powerful concept that allows CUE to do many fancy things. It also simplifies matters. For instance, there is no need for generics and enums, sum types and null coalescing are all the same thing.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cvsd"><a class="header" href="#cvsd">CVSD</a></h1>
<p>Continuously variable slope delta modulation</p>
<p>Continuously variable slope delta modulation (CVSD or CVSDM) is a voice
coding method. It is a delta modulation with variable step size (i.e.,
special case of adaptive delta modulation), first proposed by Greefkes
and Riemens in 1970.</p>
<p>CVSD encodes at 1 bit per sample, so that audio sampled at 16 kHz is
encoded at 16 kbit/s.</p>
<p>The encoder maintains a reference sample and a step size. Each input
sample is compared to the reference sample. If the input sample is
larger, the encoder emits a 1 bit and adds the step size to the
reference sample. If the input sample is smaller, the encoder emits a 0
bit and subtracts the step size from the reference sample. The encoder
also keeps the previous N bits of output (N = 3 or N = 4 are very
common) to determine adjustments to the step size; if the previous N
bits are all 1s or 0s, the step size is increased. Otherwise, the step
size is decreased (usually in an exponential manner, with
{<code>\displaystyle</code>{=tex}<code>\tau</code>{=tex}} <code>\tau</code>{=tex}being in the range of
5 ms). The step size is adjusted for every input sample processed.</p>
<p>To allow for bit errors to fade out and to allow (re)synchronization to
an ongoing bitstream, the output register (which keeps the reference
sample) is normally realized as a leaky integrator with a time constant
( {<code>\displaystyle</code>{=tex}<code>\tau</code>{=tex}} <code>\tau</code>{=tex}) of about 1 ms.</p>
<p>The decoder reverses this process, starting with the reference sample,
and adding or subtracting the step size according to the bit stream. The
sequence of adjusted reference samples are the reconstructed waveform,
and the step size is adjusted according to the same all-1s-or-0s logic
as in the encoder.</p>
<p>Adaptation of step size allows one to avoid slope overload (step of
quantization increases when the signal rapidly changes) and decreases
granular noise when the signal is constant (decrease of step of
quantisation).</p>
<p>CVSD is sometimes called a compromise between simplicity, low bitrate,
and quality. Common bitrates are 9.6--128 kbit/s.</p>
<p>Like other delta-modulation techniques, the output of the decoder does
not exactly match the original input to the encoder.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="camel-case"><a class="header" href="#camel-case">Camel Case</a></h1>
<p>Camel case (stylized as camelCase or CamelCase; also known as camel caps
or more formally as medial capitals) is the practice of writing compound
words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of
the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or
punctuation. Common examples include &quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;eBay&quot;, &quot;FedEx&quot;,
&quot;DreamWorks&quot;, and &quot;HarperCollins&quot;. It is also sometimes used in online
usernames such as &quot;JohnSmith&quot;, and to make multi-word domain names more
legible, for example in advertisements.</p>
<p>Programming and coding<br />
The use of medial caps for compound identifiers is recommended by the
coding style guidelines of many organizations or software
projects. For some languages (such as Mesa, Pascal, Modula, Java and
Microsoft's .NET) this practice is recommended by the language
developers or by authoritative manuals and has therefore become part of
the language's &quot;culture&quot;.</p>
<p>Style guidelines often distinguish between upper and lower camel case,
typically specifying which variety should be used for specific kinds of
entities: variables, record fields, methods, procedures, types, etc.
These rules are sometimes supported by static analysis tools that check
source code for adherence.</p>
<p>The original Hungarian notation for programming, for example, specifies
that a lowercase abbreviation for the &quot;usage type&quot; (not data type)
should prefix all variable names, with the remainder of the name in
upper camel case; as such it is a form of lower camel case.</p>
<p>Programming identifiers often need to contain acronyms and initialisms
that are already in uppercase, such as &quot;old HTML file&quot;. By analogy with
the title case rules, the natural camel case rendering would have the
abbreviation all in uppercase, namely &quot;oldHTMLFile&quot;. However, this
approach is problematic when two acronyms occur together (e.g., &quot;parse
DBM XML&quot; would become &quot;parseDBMXML&quot;) or when the standard mandates lower
camel case but the name begins with an abbreviation (e.g. &quot;SQL server&quot;
would become &quot;sQLServer&quot;). For this reason, some programmers prefer to
treat abbreviations as if they were lowercase words and write
&quot;oldHtmlFile&quot;, &quot;parseDbmXml&quot; or &quot;sqlServer&quot;. However, this can make it
harder to recognise that a given word is intended as an acronym.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="capability-maturity-model"><a class="header" href="#capability-maturity-model">Capability Maturity Model</a></h1>
<p>The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a development model created after
a study of data collected from organizations that contracted with the
U.S. Department of Defense, who funded the research. The term &quot;maturity&quot;
relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from
ad hoc practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics,
to active optimization of the processes.</p>
<p>The model's aim is to improve existing software development processes,
but it can also be applied to other processes.</p>
<p>Structure<br />
The model involves five aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maturity Levels: a 5-level process maturity continuum - where the
uppermost (5th) level is a notional ideal state where processes
would be systematically managed by a combination of process
optimization and continuous process improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key Process Areas: a Key Process Area identifies a cluster of
related activities that, when performed together, achieve a set of
goals considered important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goals: the goals of a key process area summarize the states that
must exist for that key process area to have been implemented in an
effective and lasting way. The extent to which the goals have been
accomplished is an indicator of how much capability the organization
has established at that maturity level. The goals signify the scope,
boundaries, and intent of each key process area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common Features: common features include practices that implement
and institutionalize a key process area. There are five types of
common features: commitment to perform, ability to perform,
activities performed, measurement and analysis, and verifying
implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key Practices: The key practices describe the elements of
infrastructure and practice that contribute most effectively to the
implementation and institutionalization of the area.</p>
<p>Levels<br />
There are five levels defined along the continuum of the model and,
according to the SEI: &quot;Predictability, effectiveness, and control of
an organization's software processes are believed to improve as the
organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the
empirical evidence to date supports this belief&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point
for use of a new or undocumented repeat process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeatable - the process is at least documented sufficiently such
that repeating the same steps may be attempted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defined - the process is defined/confirmed as a standard business
process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capable - the process is quantitatively managed in accordance with
agreed-upon metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient - process management includes deliberate process
optimization/improvement.</p>
<p>Within each of these maturity levels are Key Process Areas which
characterise that level, and for each such area there are five
factors: goals, commitment, ability, measurement, and verification.
These are not necessarily unique to CMM, representing --- as they do
--- the stages that organizations must go through on the way to
becoming mature.</p>
<p>The model provides a theoretical continuum along which process
maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the next.
Skipping levels is not allowed/feasible.</p>

<p>COBOL is a compiled English-like computer programming language
designed for business use. It is imperative, procedural and, since 2002,
object-oriented. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and
administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still
widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such
as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. But due to its
declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL
programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in
modern languages or replaced with software packages. Most programming in
COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications.</p>
<p>COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on previous
programming language design work by Grace Hopper, commonly referred to
as &quot;the (grand)mother of COBOL&quot;. It was created as part of a US
Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming
language for data processing. Intended as a stopgap, the Department of
Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting
in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has since
been revised four times. Expansions include support for structured and
object-oriented programming. The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014.</p>
<p>COBOL statements have an English-like syntax, which were designed to be
self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses
over 300 reserved words. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like y
= x;, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, MOVE x TO y).
COBOL code is split into four divisions (identification, environment,
data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs
and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies
43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.</p>

<p>A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are
typically compilers (translators that generate machine code from source
code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code,
where no pre-runtime translation takes place).</p>
<p>The term is somewhat vague. In principle, any language can be
implemented with a compiler or with an interpreter. A combination of
both solutions is also common: a compiler can translate the source code
into some intermediate form (often called p-code or bytecode), which is
then passed to an interpreter which executes it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compiler-back-end"><a class="header" href="#compiler-back-end">Compiler Back end</a></h1>
<p>The back end takes the optimized IR from the middle end. It may perform
more analysis, transformations and optimizations that are specific for
the target CPU architecture. The back end generates the target-dependent
assembly code, performing register allocation in the process. The back
end performs instruction scheduling, which re-orders instructions to
keep parallel execution units busy by filling delay slots. Although most
algorithms for optimization are NP-hard, heuristic techniques are
well-developed and currently implemented in production-quality
compilers. Typically the output of a back end is machine code
specialized for a particular processor and operating system.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compiler-front-end"><a class="header" href="#compiler-front-end">Compiler Front end</a></h1>
<p>The front end verifies syntax and semantics according to a specific
source language. For statically typed languages it performs type
checking by collecting type information. If the input program is
syntactically incorrect or has a type error, it generates errors and
warnings, highlighting[dubious -- discuss] them on the source code.
Aspects of the front end include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and
semantic analysis. The front end transforms the input program into an
intermediate representation (IR) for further processing by the middle
end. This IR is usually a lower-level representation of the program with
respect to the source code</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compiler-middle-end"><a class="header" href="#compiler-middle-end">Compiler Middle end</a></h1>
<p>The middle end performs optimizations on the IR that are independent of
the CPU architecture being targeted. This source code/machine code
independence is intended to enable generic optimizations to be shared
between versions of the compiler supporting different languages and
target processors. Examples of middle end optimizations are removal of
useless (dead code elimination) or unreachable code (reachability
analysis), discovery and propagation of constant values (constant
propagation), relocation of computation to a less frequently executed
place (e.g., out of a loop), or specialization of computation based on

<p>In computer science, a preprocessor is a program that processes its
input data to produce output that is used as input to another program.
The output is said to be a preprocessed form of the input data, which is
often used by some subsequent programs like compilers. The amount and
kind of processing done depends on the nature of the preprocessor; some
preprocessors are only capable of performing relatively simple textual
substitutions and macro expansions, while others have the power of
full-fledged programming languages.</p>
<p>A common example from computer programming is the processing performed
on source code before the next step of compilation. In some computer
languages (e.g., C and PL/I) there is a phase of translation known as
preprocessing. It can also include macro processing, file inclusion and
language extensions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="complier"><a class="header" href="#complier">Complier</a></h1>
<p>A compiler is computer software that transforms computer code written in
one programming language (the source language) into another programming
language (the target language). Compilers are a type of translator that
support digital devices, primarily computers. The name compiler is
primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level
programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language,
object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.</p>
<p>However, there are many different types of compilers. If the compiled
program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different
from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a
cross-compiler. A bootstrap compiler is written in the language that it
intends to compile. A program that translates from a low-level language
to a higher level one is a decompiler. A program that translates between
high-level languages is usually called a source-to-source compiler or
transpiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the
form of expressions without a change of language. The term
compiler-compiler refers to tools used to create parsers that perform
syntax analysis.</p>
<p>A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations:
preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis
(syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an
intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation.
Compilers implement these operations in phases that promote efficient
design and correct transformations of source input to target output.
Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very
difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler
implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="copyleft"><a class="header" href="#copyleft">Copyleft</a></h1>
<p>Copyleft (a play on the word copyright) is the practice of offering
people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of a
work with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in
derivative works down the line. Copyleft software licenses are
considered protective or reciprocal, as contrasted with permissive free
software licenses.</p>
<p>Copyleft is a form of licensing, and can be used to maintain copyright
conditions for works ranging from computer software, to documents, to
art, to scientific discoveries and instruments in medicine. In general,
copyright law is used by an author to prohibit recipients from
reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of their work. In
contrast, under copyleft, an author must give every person who receives
a copy of the work permission to reproduce, adapt, or distribute it,
with the accompanying requirement that any resulting copies or
adaptations are also bound by the same licensing agreement.</p>
<p>Copyleft licenses for software require that information necessary for
reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients
of the binaries. The source code files will usually contain a copy of
the license terms and acknowledge the authors.</p>
<p>Copyleft type licenses are a novel use of existing copyright law to
ensure a work remains freely available. The GNU General Public License
(GPL), originally written by Richard Stallman, was the first software
copyleft license to see extensive use, and continues to dominate in that
area. Creative Commons, a non-profit organization founded by Lawrence
Lessig, provides a similar license provision condition called
share-alike.</p>

Joy began distributing in 1978. Other early contributors to the ideas or
the code were Michael Ubell, Eric Allman, Mike O'Brien and Jim Kulp.</p>
<p>The C shell is a command processor typically run in a text window,
allowing the user to type commands. The C shell can also read commands
from a file, called a script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename
wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and
control structures for condition-testing and iteration. What
differentiated the C shell from others, especially in the 1980s, were
its interactive features and overall style. Its new features made it
easier and faster to use. The overall style of the language looked more

<p>Digital Access Signalling System 1 (DASS1) is a proprietary protocol
defined by British Telecom to provide ISDN services in the United
Kingdom. It is now obsolete, having been replaced by DASS2. This too
will become obsolete over the coming years as Q.931, a European
standard, becomes widely adopted in the EU.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dass2"><a class="header" href="#dass2">DASS2</a></h1>
<p>Digital Access Signalling System 2 (DASS2) is an obsolescent protocol
defined by British Telecom for digital links to PSTN based on ISDN.
Although still available on request, it has been superseded by ETS 300
102 (&quot;EuroISDN&quot;).</p>
<p>DASS2 is an improved version over DASS1, based on experiences with
DPNSS.</p>
<p>In the UK, the ISDN concept was first introduced to customers by BT with
their DASS2 connections. DASS2 (Digital Access Signalling System) is a
BT-designed signalling standard, and was introduced before the Q.931
standard was finalised by the international community. British Telecom
used the term ISDN when describing their DASS2 lines.</p>
<p>DASS2 lines are provided to customers on a 2Mbit/s link and can handle
30 simultaneous calls (64kbit/s each). DASS2 is still offered by BT and
other UK carriers. Q.931 is the name of the CCITT document that
describes the agreed signalling format for International ISDN. CCITT had
previously been known as International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee. The organisation set out the internationally
agreed standards for telecommunications, and subsequently evolved into
the ITU. In the United Kingdom, the Q.931-based protocol is ETS 300 102
(also known as EuroISDN). This is a very close implementation of the
original CCITT specification. It is a 2Mbit/s service as with DASS2, but
the feature capability is far greater and has negated the problems
associated with DASS2, including echo problems and circuit spikes. In
the UK, both DASS 2 and EuroISDN (ETS 300 102) lines are available to
customers with EuroISDN as the preferred signalling type. Customers
normally choose the desired signalling system, as this will be dictated
by their CPE (Customer Premises Equipment), usually a PABX.</p>
<p>Most modern PABXs can handle many different types of signalling system,
however the trend seems to be away from the DASS2 (which is no longer
being developed by BT and has been known to deny problems with their
DASS2 circuits), and towards the internationally recognised Q.931
standard, which is utilised by many country's telephony service
providers.</p>
<p>The CCITT specify the standards for the layers 1, 2 and 3 signalling
messages. The layer 3 messages are the messages which actually control
the call setup, teardown, and routing.</p>
<p>The layer 3 messages or call control messages are the minimum messages
that must be understood by the interfacing equipment. Individual service
providers may publish their own documentation which details further
messages that will be transported in addition to Q.931 messages. There
are a number of additional European documents that cover supplementary
services. These cover features that may be instigated by exchanges via
the ISDN and require a higher degree of layer 3 implementation.</p>

<p>Distributed Denial of Service</p>
<p>In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack
in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource
unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely
disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of
service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or
resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and
prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.[1]</p>
<p>In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming
traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This
effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a
single source.</p>
<p>A DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the
entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter,
disrupting trade.</p>

<p>Distinguished Encoding Rules</p>
<p>ER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) is a restricted variant of
BER for producing unequivocal transfer syntax for data structures
described by ASN.1. Like CER, DER encodings are valid BER encodings. DER
is the same thing as BER with all but one sender's options removed.</p>
<p>DER is a subset of BER providing for exactly one way to encode an ASN.1
value. DER is intended for situations when a unique encoding is needed,
such as in cryptography, and ensures that a data structure that needs to
be digitally signed produces a unique serialized representation. DER can
be considered a canonical form of BER. For example, in BER
a Boolean value of true can be encoded as any of 255 non-zero byte
values, while in DER there is one way to encode a Boolean value of true.</p>
<p>The most significant DER encoding constraints are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Length encoding must use the definite form</p>
<ol>
<li>Additionally, the shortest possible length encoding must be used</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bitstring, octetstring, and restricted character strings must use
the primitive encoding</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="des"><a class="header" href="#des">DES</a></h1>
<p>Data Encryption Standard</p>
<p>The Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the
encryption of electronic data. Although insecure, it was highly
influential in the advancement of modern cryptography.</p>
<p>Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by
Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of
Standards (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate
for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government
data. In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency
(NSA), the NBS eventually selected a slightly modified version
(strengthened against differential cryptanalysis, but weakened against
brute-force attacks), which was published as an official Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.</p>
<p>The publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard simultaneously
resulted in its quick international adoption and widespread academic
scrutiny. Controversies arose out of classified design elements, a
relatively short key length of the symmetric-key block cipher design,
and the involvement of the NSA, nourishing suspicions about a backdoor.
Today it is known that the S-boxes that had raised those suspicions were
in fact designed by the NSA to actually remove a backdoor they secretly
knew (differential cryptanalysis). However, the NSA also ensured that
the key size was drastically reduced such that they could break it by
brute force attack. The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received
over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their
cryptanalysis.</p>
<p>DES is insecure. This is mainly due to the 56-bit key size being too
small. In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15
minutes (see chronology). There are also some analytical results which
demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are
infeasible to mount in practice. The algorithm is believed to be
practically secure in the form of Triple DES, although there are
theoretical attacks. This cipher has been superseded by the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES). Furthermore, DES has been withdrawn as a
standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<br />

purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an
organization's local area network (LAN): an external network node can
access only what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the
organization's network is firewalled. The DMZ functions as a small,
isolated network positioned between the Internet and the private network
and, if its design is effective, allows the organization extra time to
detect and address breaches before they would further penetrate into the
internal networks.<br />

a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an
essential component of the functionality on the Internet, that has been
in use since 1985.</p>

<p>Deep Packet Inspection</p>
<p>Deep packet inspection (DPI) is a type of data processing that inspects
in detail the data being sent over a computer network, and usually takes
action by blocking, re-routing, or logging it accordingly. Deep packet
inspection is often used to ensure that data is in the correct format,
to check for malicious code, eavesdropping and internet censorship[1]
among other purposes. There are multiple headers for IP packets; network
equipment only needs to use the first of these (the IP header) for
normal operation, but use of the second header (such as TCP or UDP) is
normally considered to be shallow packet inspection (usually called
stateful packet inspection) despite this definition.[2]</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to acquire packets for deep packet inspection.
Using port mirroring (sometimes called Span Port) is a very common way,
as well as an optical splitter.</p>
<p>Deep Packet Inspection (and filtering) enables advanced network
management, user service, and security functions as well as internet
data mining, eavesdropping, and internet censorship. Although DPI has
been used for Internet management for many years, some advocates of net
neutrality fear that the technique may be used anticompetitively or to
reduce the openness of the Internet.[3]</p>
<p>DPI is used in a wide range of applications, at the so-called
&quot;enterprise&quot; level (corporations and larger institutions), in
telecommunications service providers, and in governments.</p>

to provide low-latency to critical network traffic such as voice or
streaming media while providing simple best-effort service to
non-critical services such as web traffic or file transfers.</p>
<p>DiffServ uses a 6-bit differentiated services code point (DSCP) in the

<p>Dual Tone Multi Frequency</p>
<p>Dual-tone multi-frequency signalling (DTMF) is an in-band
telecommunication signalling system using the voice-frequency band over
telephone lines between telephone equipment and other communications
devices and switching centres. DTMF was first developed in the Bell
System in the United States, and became known under the trademark
Touch-Tone for use in push-button telephones supplied to telephone
customers, starting in 1963.[1] DTMF is standardized as ITU-T
Recommendation Q.23.[2] It is also known in the UK as MF4.</p>
<p>The Touch-Tone system using a telephone keypad gradually replaced the
use of rotary dial and has become the industry standard for landline and
mobile service. Other multi-frequency systems are used for internal
signalling within the telephone network.<br />

<p>Digital Terrestrial TV</p>
<p>Digital terrestrial television (DTTV or DTT) is a technology for
broadcast television in which land-based (terrestrial) television
stations broadcast television content by radio waves to televisions in
consumers' residences in a digital format. DTTV is a major technological
advance over the previous analog television, and has largely replaced
analog which had been in common use since the middle of the last
century. Test broadcasts began in 1998 with the changeover to DTTV (aka
Analog Switchoff (ASO) or Digital Switchover (DSO)) beginning in 2006
and is now complete in many countries. The advantages of digital
terrestrial television are similar to those obtained by digitising
platforms such as cable TV, satellite, and telecommunications: more
efficient use of limited radio spectrum bandwidth, provision of more
television channels than analog, better quality images, and potentially
lower operating costs for broadcasters (after the initial upgrade
costs).</p>

<p>Digital TV</p>
<p>Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of television signals,
including the sound channel, using digital encoding, in contrast to the
earlier television technology, analog television, in which the video and
audio are carried by analog signals. It is an innovative advance that
represents the first significant evolution in television technology
since color television in the 1950s. Digital TV makes more economical
use of scarce radio spectrum space; it can transmit multiple channels in
the same bandwidth occupied by a single channel of analog television,
and provides many new features that analog television cannot. A
switchover from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2006 in some
countries, and many industrial countries have now completed the
changeover, while other countries are in various stages of adaptation.
Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in
different parts of the world</p>

<p>Dynamically Verified Static Routing</p>
<p>Dynamically Verified Static Routing (DVSR) is a proprietary routing
protocol of the former Redback (now Ericsson) available on SmartEdge and
Smart Services Router products.</p>
<p>DVSR can be defined as a semi-dynamic and semi-static routing protocol.</p>
<p>A DVSR route is based on static routing principle, but the router
regularly checks for the next hop availability before the prefix can be
injected into the local routing table and redistributed towards other
routing tables. The DVSR route configuration allows the setup of success
and failure counters used to declare the route as active or not. It
could be described as a number of DVSR router attempts to ping the next
hop; in case of a given number of successful replies the route is added
to the local routing table or, after a set number of consecutive
failures, the route is withdrawn.</p>
<p>SmartEdge routers support DVSR as a unique edge routing feature in
addition to static routing and regular IGPs, such as IS-IS, OSPF, and
RIP. DVSR is similar to normal static routing. The main difference is
that the DVSR's next hop, or some other relevant host IP address, is
dynamically verified by this protocol before the prefix can be injected
into the local routing table. In many ISP networks, using static routing
without proper next-hop checks results in black holing of network
traffic.</p>

<p>A dark fibre or unlit fibre is an unused optical fibre, available for
use in fibre-optic communication.</p>
<p>The term dark fibre was originally used when referring to the potential
network capacity of telecommunication infrastructure, but now also
refers to the increasingly common practice of leasing fibre optic cables
from a network service provider, or, generally, to the fibre
installations not owned or controlled by traditional carriers. In common
vernacular, dark fibre may sometimes still be called &quot;dark&quot; if it has
been lit by a fibre lessee and not the cable's owner.</p>
<p>A dark fibre network or simply dark network is a privately operated
optical fiber network that is run directly by its operator over dark
fibre leased or purchased from another supplier. This is in contrast to
purchasing bandwidth or leased line capacity on an existing network.
Dark fibre networks may be used for private networking, or as Internet
access or infrastructure.</p>

<p>In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general,

in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed
directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template
for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different
situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the
programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an
application or system.</p>
<p>Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and
interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final
application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply
mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages, some
patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in
support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and
object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for
non-object-oriented languages.</p>
<p>Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer
programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm
and a concrete algorithm.</p>

<p>A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of
administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet.
Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name
System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain
names are used in various networking contexts and for
application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a
domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a
personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting
a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via
the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.</p>
<p>Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS
root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are
the top-level domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains
(gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and
the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Below these top-level
domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain
names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to
connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly
accessible Internet resources or run web sites.</p>
<p>The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain
name registrars who sell their services to the public.</p>
<p>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely
specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts
omitted. Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may
therefore be written in any desired capitalization method, but most
commonly domain names are written in lowercase in technical contexts.<br />
<img src="Glossary/d/./images/15008007.png?width=350" alt="" /></p>
<p>Domain name space<br />
Today, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
manages the top-level development and architecture of the Internet
domain name space. It authorizes domain name registrars, through which
domain names may be registered and reassigned.</p>
<p>The hierarchical domain name system, organized into zones, each served
by domain name servers.<br />
The domain name space consists of a tree of domain names. Each node in
the tree holds information associated with the domain name. The tree
sub-divides into zones beginning at the DNS root zone.<br />

<p>A simple view for dot1q (802.1q) trunking:<br />
For ease of understanding the Dot1q (802.1q) trunking between switches
can be seen as pipes (VLANs) inside a main pipe (Trunk) to connect VLANs
that are being distributed on different switches.<br />
<img src="Glossary/d/./images/15008019.png?width=448" alt="" /><br />
So if that makes sense then a better representation is that packets are
tagged as they go into the trunk link, like below.<br />
The packets are tagged with the VLAN ID, that the port they are received
on is configured with. When they are received on the other end they are
then sent to the appropriate VLAN ports.<br />
<img src="Glossary/d/./images/15008025.png?width=448" alt="" /><br />
So how does the switch know which ports to send the packet to, the
switches are assigned with the VLAN number.<br />

<p>IEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q</p>
<p>IEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q, is the networking standard that
supports virtual LANs (VLANs) on an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network. The
standard defines a system of VLAN tagging for Ethernet frames and the
accompanying procedures to be used by bridges and switches in handling
such frames. The standard also contains provisions for a
quality-of-service prioritization scheme commonly known as IEEE 802.1p
and defines the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol.</p>
<p>Portions of the network which are VLAN-aware (i.e., IEEE 802.1Q
conformant) can include VLAN tags. When a frame enters the VLAN-aware
portion of the network, a tag is added to represent the VLAN
membership.[a] Each frame must be distinguishable as being within
exactly one VLAN. A frame in the VLAN-aware portion of the network that
does not contain a VLAN tag is assumed to be flowing on the native VLAN.</p>

the mobile phone network that communicates directly wirelessly with
mobile handsets (UEs), like a base transceiver station (BTS) in GSM
networks.</p>
<p>Traditionally, a Node B has minimum functionality, and is controlled by
a Radio Network Controller (RNC). However, with an eNB, there is no
separate controller element. This simplifies the architecture and allows
lower response times.</p>

<p>Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution</p>
<p>Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) (also known as Enhanced
GPRS (EGPRS), or IMT Single Carrier (IMT-SC), or Enhanced Data rates for
Global Evolution) is a digital mobile phone technology that allows
improved data transmission rates as a backward-compatible extension of
GSM. EDGE is considered a pre-3G radio technology and is part of ITU's
3G definition. EDGE was deployed on GSM networks beginning in 2003 --
initially by Cingular (now AT&amp;T) in the United States.</p>
<p>EDGE is standardized also by 3GPP as part of the GSM family. A variant,
so called Compact-EDGE, was developed for use in a portion of Digital
AMPS network spectrum.</p>
<p>Through the introduction of sophisticated methods of coding and
transmitting data, EDGE delivers higher bit-rates per radio channel,
resulting in a threefold increase in capacity and performance compared
with an ordinary GSM/GPRS connection.</p>
<p>EDGE can be used for any packet switched application, such as an

<p>Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE) is an approved
telecommunications networking standard, IEEE 802.1Qay-2009. PBB-TE
adapts Ethernet technology to carrier class transport networks. It is
based on the layered VLAN tags and MAC-in-MAC encapsulation defined in
IEEE 802.1ah (Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB)), but it differs from PBB
in eliminating flooding, dynamically created forwarding tables, and
spanning tree protocols. Compared to PBB and its predecessors, PBB-TE
behaves more predictably and its behavior can be more easily controlled
by the network operator, at the expense of requiring up-front connection
configuration at each bridge along a forwarding path. PBB-TE Operations,
Administration, and Management (OAM) is usually based on IEEE 802.1ag.
It was initially based on Nortel's Provider Backbone Transport (PBT).</p>
<p>PBB-TE's connection-oriented features and behaviors, as well as its OAM
approach, are inspired by SDH/SONET. PBB-TE can also provide path
protection levels similar to the UPSR (Unidirectional Path Switched
Ring) protection in SDH/SONET networks.</p>
<p>Principle of operation<br />
The IEEE 802.1Qay PBB-TE standard extends the functionality of IEEE
802.1ah Provider Backbone Bridges, adding a connection-oriented mode
using point-to-point trunks that deliver resiliency and configurable
performance levels.</p>
<p>A service is identified by an I-SID (Backbone Service Instance
Identifier) and each service is associated with a PBB-TE trunk. Each
PBB-TE trunk is identified by a triplet of B-SA, B-DA and B-VID. The
B-SA and B-DA identify the source and destination bridges, respectively,
that are the endpoints of the trunk. The B-VID is a backbone VLAN
identifier that is used to distinguish different trunks to the same
destination. The management system configures the PBB-TE trunks on all
the edge and core bridges by creating static forwarding database
entries; the management system is responsible for ensuring that there
are no forwarding loops.</p>
<p>The backbone edge bridges map frames to and from an I-SID and perform
the MAC header encapsulation and decapsulation functions. The core
bridges act as transit nodes. The packets are forwarded based on outer
VLAN ID (B-VID) and Destination MAC address (B-DA).</p>
<p>Forwarding is based on the static forwarding database (FDB) entries;
dynamic MAC learning is not used. Any incoming broadcast or multicast
frames are either dropped or encapsulated as unicast within the trunk.
All Destination Lookup Failure packets are dropped rather than flooded.
By eliminating any broadcasting or flooding, and by using only the
loop-free forwarding paths configured by management, there is no longer
any need to use a spanning tree protocol.</p>
<p>Path protection is provided by configuring one work and one protect
B-VID for each backbone service instance. In case of work path failure
(as indicated by loss of 802.1ag continuity check messages, CCMs) the
source bridge swaps the B-VID value to redirect the traffic onto the
preconfigured protection path within 50 ms.</p>
<p>PBB-TE equipment leverages economies of scale inherent in Ethernet,
promising solutions that are 30% to 40% cheaper than T-MPLS networks
with identical features and capabilities, giving PBB-TE a better overall
return on investment.</p>

<p>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol</p>
<p>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an advanced
distance-vector routing protocol that is used on a computer network for
automating routing decisions and configuration. The protocol was
designed by Cisco Systems as a proprietary protocol, available only on
Cisco routers. Functionality of EIGRP was converted to an open standard
in 2013[1] and was published with informational status as RFC 7868 in
2016.</p>
<p>EIGRP is used on a router to share routes with other routers within the
same autonomous system. Unlike other well known routing protocols, such
as RIP, EIGRP only sends incremental updates, reducing the workload on
the router and the amount of data that needs to be transmitted.</p>
<p>EIGRP replaced the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) in 1993. One
of the major reasons for this was the change to classless IPv4 addresses
in the Internet Protocol, which IGRP could not support.</p>

<p>Enterprise Service Bus</p>
<p>An enterprise service bus (ESB) implements a communication system
between mutually interacting software applications in a service-oriented
architecture (SOA). It implements a software architecture as depicted in
the picture. As it implements a distributed computing architecture, it
implements a special variant of the more general client-server model,
wherein, in general, any application using ESB can behave as server or
client in turns. ESB promotes agility and flexibility with regard to
high-level protocol communication between applications. The primary goal
of the high-level protocol communication is enterprise application
integration (EAI) of heterogeneous and complex service or application
landscapes (a view from the network level).<br />
The concept is analogous to the bus concept found in computer hardware
architecture combined with the modular and concurrent design of
high-performance computer operating systems. The motivation for the
development of ESB was to find a standard, structured, and general
purpose concept for describing implementation of loosely coupled
software components (called services) that are expected to be
independently deployed, running, heterogeneous, and disparate within a
network. ESB is also a common implementation pattern for
service-oriented architecture.</p>
<p>An ESB applies the design concept of modern operating systems to
independent services running within networks of disparate and
independent computers. Like concurrent operating systems, an ESB
provides commodity services in addition to adoption, translation and
routing of client requests to appropriate answering services.</p>
<p>The primary duties of an ESB are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Route messages between services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor and control routing of message exchange between services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolve contention between communicating service components</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control deployment and versioning of services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marshal use of redundant services</p>

<li>
<p>Provide commodity services like event handling, data transformation

<p>ETL is short for extract, transform, load, three database functions that
are combined into one tool to pull data out of one database and place it
into another database.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extract is the process of reading data from a database. In this
stage, the data is collected, often from multiple and different
types of sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transform is the process of converting the extracted data from its
previous form into the form it needs to be in so that it can be
placed into another database. Transformation occurs by using rules
or lookup tables or by combining the data with other data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load is the process of writing the data into the target database.<br />
Data from one or more sources is extracted and then copied to the
data warehouse. When dealing with large volumes of data and multiple
source systems, the data is consolidated. ETL is used to migrate
data from one database to another, and is often the specific process
required to load data to and from data marts and data warehouses,
but is a process that is also used to large convert (transform)
databases from one format or type to another.</p>

Forum (MEF) as an association between two or more user network
interfaces that identifies a point-to-point or multipoint-to-multipoint
path within the service provider network. An EVC is a conceptual service
pipe within the service provider network. A bridge domain is a local

<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Line</p>
<p>Ethernet private line (EPL) and Ethernet virtual private line (EVPL) are
data services defined by the MEF. EPL provides a point-to-point Ethernet
virtual connection (EVC) between a pair of dedicated user--network
interfaces (UNIs), with a high degree of transparency. EVPL provides a
point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connection between a pair of UNIs.</p>
<p>The services are categorized as an E-Line service type, with an
expectation of low frame delay, frame delay variation and frame loss
ratio. EPL is implemented using a point-to-point EVC with no Service
Multiplexing at each UNI (physical interface), i.e., all service frames
at the UNI are mapped to a single EVC (a.k.a. all-to-one bundling).</p>
<p>Due to a high degree of transparency, EPL is often used to provide
point-to-point Transparent LAN Service (TLS), where the service frame's
header and payload are identical at both the source and destination UNI.
Some implementations tunnel most Ethernet Layer 2 Control Protocols
(L2CPs) except for some link layer L2CPs such as IEEE 802.3x pause
frames.</p>
<p>Unlike EPL, EVPL allows for service multiplexing, i.e., multiple EVCs or
Ethernet services per UNI. The other difference between the EVPL and EPL
is the degree of transparency - while EPL is highly transparent,
filtering only the pause frames, EVPL is required to either peer or drop
most of the Layer 2 Control Protocols.</p>

<p>Echo has a major effect on voice quality in telecommunication networks.
The objectionable effect of echo results from a combination of
reflections from network components such as 2- to 4-wire converters,
together with signal processing and transmission delay. Echo may cause
users difficulty in<br />
talking or listening over a telephone connection. It may also affect the
transmission of voiceband data, fax, and text telephones.<br />
Digital network echo cancellers are designed to eliminate echo for the
user and to allow successful transmission of voiceband data and fax.
Recommendation ITU-T G.168 describes the characteristics of an echo
canceller, including the requirement for in-band tone disabling and
other control<br />
mechanisms. It also describes a number of laboratory tests that should
be performed on an echo canceller to assess its performance under
conditions likely to be experienced in the network</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="echo-cancellation"><a class="header" href="#echo-cancellation">Echo cancellation</a></h1>
<p>Echo suppression and echo cancellation are methods used in telephony to
improve voice quality by preventing echo from being created or removing
it after it is already present. In addition to improving subjective
audio quality, echo suppression increases the capacity achieved through
silence suppression by preventing echo from traveling across a network.
Echo suppressors were developed in the 1950s in response to the first
use of satellites for telecommunications, but they have since been
largely supplanted by better performing echo cancellers.</p>
<p>Echo suppression and cancellation methods are commonly called acoustic
echo suppression (AES) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), and more
rarely line echo cancellation (LEC). In some cases, these terms are more
precise, as there are various types and causes of echo with unique
characteristics, including acoustic echo (sounds from a loudspeaker
being reflected and recorded by a microphone, which can vary
substantially over time) and line echo (electrical impulses caused by,
e.g., coupling between the sending and receiving wires, impedance
mismatches, electrical reflections, etc., which varies much less than
acoustic echo). In practice, however, the same techniques are used to
treat all types of echo, so an acoustic echo canceller can cancel line
echo as well as acoustic echo. AEC in particular is commonly used to
refer to echo cancelers in general, regardless of whether they were
intended for acoustic echo, line echo, or both.</p>
<p>Although echo suppressors and echo cancellers have similar
goals---preventing a speaking individual from hearing an echo of their
own voice---the methods they use are different:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Echo suppressors work by detecting a voice signal going in one
direction on a circuit, and then muting or attenuating the signal in
other direction. Usually the echo suppressor at the far end of the
circuit does this muting when it detects voice coming from the
near-end of the circuit. This muting prevents the speaker from
hearing their own voice returning from the far end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Echo cancellation involves first recognizing the originally
transmitted signal that re-appears, with some delay, in the
transmitted or received signal. Once the echo is recognized, it can
be removed by subtracting it from the transmitted or received
signal. This technique is generally implemented digitally using a
digital signal processor or software, although it can be implemented
in analog circuits as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="echo"><a class="header" href="#echo">Echo</a></h1>
<p>In audio signal processing and acoustics, Echo is a reflection of sound
that arrives at the listener with a delay after the direct sound. The
delay is proportional to the distance of the reflecting surface from the
source and the listener. Typical examples are the echo produced by the
bottom of a well, by a building, or by the walls of an enclosed room and
an empty room. A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source.</p>

<p>Ethernet frames which are to be sent on the SDH link are sent through an

create a synchronous stream of data from the asynchronous Ethernet
packets. The synchronous stream of encapsulated data is then passed
through a mapping block which typically uses virtual concatenation
(VCAT) to route the stream of bits over one or more SDH paths. As this
is byte interleaved, it provides a better level of security compared to
other mechanisms for Ethernet transport.</p>

<p>Ethernet over twisted-pair technologies use twisted-pair cables for the
physical layer of an Ethernet computer network. They are a subset of all
Ethernet physical layers.</p>
<p>Early Ethernet used various grades of coaxial cable, but in 1984,
StarLAN showed the potential of simple unshielded twisted pair. This led
to the development of 10BASE-T and its successors 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T
and 10GBASE-T, supporting speeds of 10 and 100 megabit per second, then
1 and 10 gigabit per second respectively.</p>
<p>Two new variants of 10 megabit per second Ethernet over a single twisted
pair, known as 10BASE-T1S and 10BASE-T1L, were standardized in IEEE Std
802.3cg-2019.[2] 10BASE-T1S has its origins in the automotive industry
and may be useful in other short-distance applications where substantial
electrical noise is present. 10BASE-T1L is a long-distance Ethernet,
supporting connections up to 1 km in length. Both of these standards are
finding applications implementing the Internet of things.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fips-140-2"><a class="header" href="#fips-140-2">FIPS 140-2</a></h1>
<p>The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2,
(FIPS PUB 140-2), is a U.S. government computer security standard used
to approve cryptographic modules. The title is Security
Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. Initial publication was on May
25, 2001 and was last updated December 3, 2002</p>
<p>Purpose<br />
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued the
FIPS 140 Publication Series to coordinate the requirements and
standards for cryptography modules that include both hardware and
software components. Protection of a cryptographic module within a
security system is necessary to maintain the confidentiality and
integrity of the information protected by the module. This standard
specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a
cryptographic module. The standard provides four increasing, qualitative
levels of security intended to cover a wide range of potential
applications and environments. The security requirements cover areas
related to the secure design and implementation of a cryptographic
module. These areas include cryptographic module specification;
cryptographic module ports and interfaces; roles, services, and
authentication; finite state model; physical security; operational
environment; cryptographic key management; electromagnetic
interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC); self-tests; design
assurance; and mitigation of other attacks.</p>
<p>Federal agencies and departments can validate that the module in use is
covered by an existing FIPS 140-1 or FIPS 140-2 certificate that
specifies the exact module name, hardware, software, firmware, and/or
applet version numbers. The cryptographic modules are produced by
the private sector or open source communities for use by the U.S.
government and other regulated industries (such as financial and
health-care institutions) that collect, store, transfer, share and
disseminate sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. A commercial
cryptographic module is also commonly referred to as a hardware security
module (HSM).</p>
<p>Security levels<br />
FIPS 140-2 defines four levels of security, simply named &quot;Level 1&quot; to
&quot;Level 4&quot;. It does not specify in detail what level of security is
required by any particular application.</p>
<p>Level 1<br />
Security Level 1 provides the lowest level of security. Basic security
requirements are specified for a cryptographic module (e.g., at least
one Approved algorithm or Approved security function shall be used). No
specific physical security mechanisms are required in a Security Level 1
cryptographic module beyond the basic requirement for production-grade
components. An example of a Security Level 1 cryptographic module is a
personal computer (PC) encryption board.</p>
<p>Level 2<br />
Security Level 2 improves upon the physical security mechanisms of a
Security Level 1 cryptographic module by requiring features that show
evidence of tampering, including tamper-evident coatings or seals that
must be broken to attain physical access to the plaintext cryptographic
keys and critical security parameters (CSPs) within the module, or
pick-resistant locks on covers or doors to protect against unauthorized
physical access.</p>
<p>Level 3<br />
In addition to the tamper-evident physical security mechanisms required
at Security Level 2, Security Level 3 attempts to prevent the intruder
from gaining access to CSPs held within the cryptographic module.
Physical security mechanisms required at Security Level 3 are intended
to have a high probability of detecting and responding to attempts at
physical access, use or modification of the cryptographic module. The
physical security mechanisms may include the use of strong enclosures
and tamper-detection/response circuitry that zeroes all plaintext CSPs
when the removable covers/doors of the cryptographic module are opened.</p>
<p>Level 4<br />
Security Level 4 provides the highest level of security. At this
security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete
envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent
of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical
access. Penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure from any
direction has a very high probability of being detected, resulting in
the immediate deletion of all plaintext CSPs.</p>
<p>Security Level 4 cryptographic modules are useful for operation in
physically unprotected environments. Security Level 4 also protects a
cryptographic module against a security compromise due to environmental
conditions or fluctuations outside of the module's normal operating
ranges for voltage and temperature. Intentional excursions beyond the
normal operating ranges may be used by an attacker to thwart a
cryptographic module's defenses. A cryptographic module is required to
either include special environmental protection features designed to
detect fluctuations and delete CSPs, or to undergo rigorous
environmental failure testing to provide a reasonable assurance that the
module will not be affected by fluctuations outside of the normal
operating range in a manner that can compromise the security of the
module.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fips"><a class="header" href="#fips">FIPS</a></h1>
<p>Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are publicly announced
standards developed by the United States federal government for use in
computer systems by non-military government agencies and government
contractors.</p>
<p>FIPS standards are issued to establish requirements for various purposes
such as ensuring computer security and interoperability, and are
intended for cases in which suitable industry standards do not already
exist. Many FIPS specifications are modified versions of standards used
in the technical communities, such as the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fqdn"><a class="header" href="#fqdn">FQDN</a></h1>
<p>Fully Qualified Domain Name</p>
<p>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an
absolute domain name, is a domain name that specifies its exact location
in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all
domain levels, including at least a second-level domain and a top-level
domain. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of
ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way.</p>
<p>The DNS root domain is unnamed which is expressed by having an empty
label in the DNS hierarchy, resulting in a fully qualified domain name
ending with the top-level domain. However, in some cases the full stop
(period) character is required at the end of the fully qualified domain
name.</p>
<p>In contrast to a domain name that is fully specified, a domain name that
does not include the full path of labels up to the DNS root is often
called a partially qualified domain name.</p>

digital information is transmitted through discrete frequency changes of
a carrier signal. The technology is used for communication systems such
as amateur radio, caller ID and emergency broadcasts. The simplest FSK
is binary FSK (BFSK). BFSK uses a pair of discrete frequencies to
transmit binary (0s and 1s) information. With this scheme, the &quot;1&quot; is
called the mark frequency and the &quot;0&quot; is called the space frequency.<br />

broader term which is more widespread in the industry is small cell,
with femtocell as a subset. It is also called femto AccessPoint (AP). It
connects to the service provider's network via broadband (such as DSL or
cable); current designs typically support four to eight simultaneously
active mobile phones in a residential setting depending on version
number and femtocell hardware, and eight to sixteen mobile phones in
enterprise settings. A femtocell allows service providers to extend
service coverage indoors or at the cell edge, especially where access
would otherwise be limited or unavailable. Although much attention is
focused on WCDMA, the concept is applicable to all standards, including
GSM, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA, WiMAX and LTE solutions.<br />

<p>Fortran is a general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language
that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific
computing.</p>
<p>Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering
applications, FORTRAN came to dominate this area of programming early on
and has been in continuous use for over half a century in
computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction,
finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational
physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular
language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that
benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.</p>
<p>Fortran encompasses a lineage of versions, each of which evolved to add
extensions to the language while usually retaining compatibility with
prior versions. Successive versions have added support for structured
programming and processing of character-based data (FORTRAN 77), array
programming, modular programming and generic programming (Fortran 90),
high performance Fortran (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming
(Fortran 2003) and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).</p>
<p>Fortran's design was the basis for many other programming languages.
Among the better known is BASIC, which is a based on FORTRAN II with a
number of syntax cleanups, notably better logical structures, and other
changes to more easily work in an interactive environment.</p>

telecommunications channels using a packet switching methodology.
Originally designed for transport across Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) infrastructure, it may be used today in the context of
many other network interfaces.</p>
<p>Network providers commonly implement Frame Relay for voice (VoFR) and
data as an encapsulation technique used between local area networks
(LANs) over a wide area network (WAN). Each end-user gets a private line
(or leased line) to a Frame Relay node. The Frame Relay network handles
the transmission over a frequently changing path transparent to all
end-user extensively used WAN protocols. It is less expensive than
leased lines and that is one reason for its popularity. The extreme
simplicity of configuring user equipment in a Frame Relay network offers
another reason for Frame Relay's popularity.</p>

<p>G.711.1 is an extension to G.711, published as ITU-T Recommendation
G.711.1 in March 2008. Its formal name is Wideband embedded extension
for G.711 pulse code modulation.</p>
<p>G.711.1, allows the addition of narrowband and/or wideband (16000
samples/s) enhancements, each at 25% of the bitrate of the (included)
base G.711 bitstream, leading to data rates of 64, 80 or 96 kbit/s.</p>
<p>G.711.1 is compatible with G.711 at 64 kbit/s, hence an efficient
deployment in existing G.711-based voice over IP (VoIP) infrastructures
is foreseen. The G.711.1 coder can encode signals at 16 kHz with a
bandwidth of 50--7000 Hz at 80 and 96 kbit/s, and for 8-kHz sampling the
output may produce signals with a bandwidth ranging from 50 up to 4000
Hz, operating at 64 and 80 kbit/s.</p>
<p>The G.711.1 encoder creates an embedded bitstream structured in three
layers corresponding to three available bit rates: 64, 80 and 96 kbit/s.
The bitstream does not contain any information on which layers are
contained, an implementation would require outband signalling on which
layers are available. The three G.711.1 layers are: log companded pulse
code modulation (PCM) of the lower band including noise feedback,
embedded PCM extension with adaptive bit allocation for enhancing the
quality of the base layer in the lower band, and weighted vector
quantization coding of the higher band based on modified discrete cosine
transformation (MDCT).</p>
<p>Two extensions for G.711.1 are planned in 2010: superwideband extension
(bandwidth to 14000 Hz) and lossless bitstream compression.</p>

<p>G.711 is an ITU-T standard for audio companding. It is primarily used in

standard in many technologies, for example in H.320 and H.323
specifications. It can also be used for fax communication over IP
networks (as defined in T.38 specification). G.711, also known as Pulse
Code Modulation (PCM), is a very commonly used waveform codec. G.711 is
a narrowband audio codec that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s.
G.711 passes audio signals in the range of 300--3400 Hz and samples them
at the rate of 8,000 samples per second, with the tolerance on that rate
of 50 parts per million (ppm). Non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization
with 8 bits is used to represent each sample, resulting in a 64 kbit/s
bit rate. There are two slightly different versions: μ-law, which is
used primarily in North America and Japan, and A-law, which is in use in
most other countries outside North America.</p>
<p>Two enhancements to G.711 have been published: G.711.0 utilizes lossless
data compression to reduce the bandwidth usage and G.711.1 increases
audio quality by increasing bandwidth.</p>
<p>Types<br />
G.711 defines two main companding algorithms, the µ-law algorithm and
A-law algorithm. Both are logarithmic, but A-law was specifically
designed to be simpler for a computer to process. The standard also
defines a sequence of repeating code values which defines the power
level of 0 dB.</p>
<p>The µ-law and A-law algorithms encode 14-bit and 13-bit signed linear
PCM samples (respectively) to logarithmic 8-bit samples. Thus, the G.711
encoder will create a 64 kbit/s bitstream for a signal sampled at 8 kHz.</p>
<p>G.711 μ-law tends to give more resolution to higher range signals while
G.711 A-law provides more quantization levels at lower signal levels.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="g719"><a class="header" href="#g719">G.719</a></h1>
<p>G.719 is an ITU-T standard audio coding format providing high quality,
moderate bit rate (32 to 128 kbit/s) wideband (20 Hz - 20 kHz audio
bandwidth, 48 kHz audio sample rate) audio coding at low computational
load. It was produced through a collaboration between Polycom and
Ericsson.</p>
<p>G.719 incorporates elements of Polycom's Siren22 codec (22 kHz) and
Ericsson codec technology, as well as Polycom's Siren7 and Siren14
codecs (G.722.1 and G.722.1 Annex C), which have been used in
videoconferencing systems for many years. As ITU-T Recommendation G.719,
it was approved on June 13, 2008.</p>
<p>G.719 is optimized for both speech and music. It is based on transform
coding with adaptive time-resolution, adaptive bit-allocation and low
complexity lattice vector quantization. The computational complexity is
quite low (18 floating-point MIPS) for an efficient high-quality
compressor. The codec operates on 20 ms frames, and the algorithmic
delay end-to-end is 40 ms. The encoder input and decoder output are
sampled at 48 kHz.</p>
<p>In addition to the nominal bit rates of 32, 48 and 64 kbit/s, the G.719
codec has an inherent feature of flexible rate selection. In fact, it is
possible to accommodate any rate between 32 kbit/s and 64 kbit/s by
steps of 4 kbit/s. Moreover, the codec can also provide higher rates
than 64 kbit/s and up to 128 kbit/s.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="g722"><a class="header" href="#g722">G.722</a></h1>
<p>G.722 is an ITU-T standard 7 kHz Wideband audio codec operating at 48,
56 and 64 kbit/s. It was approved by ITU-T in November 1988. Technology
of the codec is based on sub-band ADPCM (SB-ADPCM).</p>
<p>G722 provides improved speech quality due to a wider speech bandwidth of
50--7000 Hz compared to narrowband speech coders like G.711 which in
general are optimized for POTS wireline quality of 300--3400 Hz. G.722
sample audio data at a rate of 16 kHz (using 14 bits), double that of
traditional telephony interfaces, which results in superior audio
quality and clarity.[2]</p>
<p>Other ITU-T 7 kHz wideband codecs include G.722.1 and G.722.2. These
codecs are not variants of G.722 and they use different patented
compression technologies. G.722.1 is based on Siren codecs and offers
lower bit-rate compressions (24 kbit/s or 32 kbit/s). A more recent
G.722.2, also known as AMR-WB (&quot;Adaptive Multirate Wideband&quot;) is based
on ACELP and offers even lower bit-rate compressions (6.6 kbit/s to
23.85 kbit/s), as well as the ability to quickly adapt to varying
compressions as the network topography mutates. In the latter case,
bandwidth is automatically conserved when network congestion is high.
When congestion returns to a normal level, a lower-compression,
higher-quality bitrate is restored.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="g7231"><a class="header" href="#g7231">G.723.1</a></h1>
<p>G.723.1 is an audio codec for voice that compresses voice audio in 30 ms
frames. An algorithmic look-ahead of 7.5 ms duration means that total
algorithmic delay is 37.5 ms. Its official name is Dual rate speech
coder for multimedia communications transmitting at 5.3 and 6.3 kbit/s.
It is sometimes associated with a Truespeech trademark in coprocessors
produced by DSP Group.[1]</p>
<p>This is a completely different codec from G.723.</p>
<p>There are two bit rates at which G.723.1 can operate:</p>
<p>6.3 kbit/s (using 24 byte frames) using a MPC-MLQ algorithm (MOS 3.9)<br />
5.3 kbit/s (using 20 byte frames) using an ACELP algorithm (MOS 3.62)</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="g726"><a class="header" href="#g726">G.726</a></h1>
<p>G.726 is an ITU-T ADPCM speech codec standard covering the transmission
of voice at rates of 16, 24, 32, and 40 kbit/s. It was introduced to
supersede both G.721, which covered ADPCM at 32 kbit/s, and G.723, which
described ADPCM for 24 and 40 kbit/s. G.726 also introduced a new 16
kbit/s rate. The four bit rates associated with G.726 are often referred
to by the bit size of a sample, which are 2, 3, 4, and 5-bits
respectively.</p>
<p>The most commonly used mode is 32 kbit/s, which doubles the usable
network capacity by using half the rate of G.711. It is primarily used
on international trunks in the phone network and is the standard codec
used in DECT wireless phone systems. The principal application of 24 and
16 kbit/s channels is for overload channels carrying voice in digital
circuit multiplication equipment (DCME). The principal application of 40
kbit/s channels is to carry data modem signals in DCME, especially for
modems operating at greater than 4800 bit/s.</p>

<p>Gateway GPRS support node</p>
<p>The gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) is a main component of the GPRS
network. The GGSN is responsible for the internetworking between the
GPRS network and external packet switched networks, such as the Internet
or an X.25 network.</p>
<p>From an external network's point of view, the GGSN is a router to a
&quot;sub-network&quot;, because the GGSN 'hides' the GPRS infrastructure from the
external network. When the GGSN receives data addressed to a specific
user, it checks if the user is active. If it is, the GGSN forwards the
data to the SGSN serving the mobile user, but if the mobile user is
inactive, the data is discarded. In the other direction,
mobile-originated packets are routed to the right network by the GGSN.</p>
<p>The GGSN is the anchor point that enables the mobility of the user
terminal in the GPRS/UMTS networks. In essence, it carries out the role
in GPRS equivalent to the home agent in Mobile IP. It maintains routing
necessary to tunnel the protocol data units (PDUs) to the SGSN that
services a particular MS (mobile station).</p>
<p>The GGSN converts the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN into the
appropriate packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or X.25) and
sends them out on the corresponding packet data network. In the other
direction, PDP addresses of incoming data packets are converted to the
GSM address of the destination user. The readdressed packets are sent to
the responsible SGSN. For this purpose, the GGSN stores the current SGSN
address of the user and his or her profile in its location register. The
GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router
for the connected user equipment (UE). The GGSN also performs
authentication and charging functions.</p>
<p>Other functions include subscriber screening, IP pool management and
address mapping, QoS and PDP context enforcement.</p>
<p>With LTE scenario the GGSN functionality moves to SAE gateway (with SGSN
functionality working in MME).</p>

<p>GNU is a recursive acronym for &quot;GNU's Not Unix!&quot;, chosen because GNU's
design is Unix-like, but differs from Unix by being free software and
containing no Unix code.The GNU project includes an operating system
kernel, GNU HURD, which was the original focus of the Free Software

also be used with GNU software; as the Hurd kernel is not yet
production-ready,[20] this is how the GNU system is usually used.The
combination of GNU software and the Linux kernel is commonly known as
Linux (or less frequently GNU/Linux; see GNU/Linux naming controversy).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="gpl"><a class="header" href="#gpl">GPL</a></h1>
<p>The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free
software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study,
share and modify the software. The license was originally written by
Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU
Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of
the Free Software Definition. The GPL is a copyleft license, which means
that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license
terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of
which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL
was the first copyleft license for general use.</p>
<p>Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular
software licenses in the free and open-source software domain. Prominent
free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel
and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the
copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based
systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the
assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free,
rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to
give anything back to the community.</p>
<p>In 2007, the third version of the license (GNU GPLv3) was released to
address some perceived problems with the second version (GNU GPLv2) that
were discovered during its long-time usage. To keep the license up to
date, the GPL license includes an optional &quot;any later version&quot; clause,
allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new
versions as updated by the FSF. Developers can omit it when licensing
their software; for instance the Linux kernel is licensed under GPLv2
without the &quot;any later version&quot; clause.</p>

<p>General Packet Radio Service</p>
<p>General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet oriented mobile data
standard on the 2G and 3G cellular communication network's global system
for mobile communications (GSM). GPRS was established by European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in response to the earlier
CDPD and i-mode packet-switched cellular technologies. It is now
maintained by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p>
<p>GPRS is typically sold according to the total volume of data transferred
during the billing cycle, in contrast with circuit switched data, which
is usually billed per minute of connection time, or sometimes by
one-third minute increments. Usage above the GPRS bundled data cap may
be charged per Mb of data, speed limited, or disallowed.</p>
<p>GPRS is a best-effort service, implying variable throughput and latency
that depend on the number of other users sharing the service
concurrently, as opposed to circuit switching, where a certain quality
of service (QoS) is guaranteed during the connection. In 2G systems,
GPRS provides data rates of 56--114 kbit/sec. 2G cellular technology
combined with GPRS is sometimes described as 2.5G, that is, a technology
between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony.
It provides moderate-speed data transfer, by using unused time division
multiple access (TDMA) channels in, for example, the GSM system. GPRS is
integrated into GSM Release 97 and newer releases.<br />

<p>GSM Adaptive Multi-Rate</p>
<p>The Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR, AMR-NB or GSM-AMR) audio codec is an audio
compression format optimized for speech coding. AMR speech codec
consists of a multi-rate narrowband speech codec that encodes narrowband
(200--3400 Hz) signals at variable bit rates ranging from 4.75 to 12.2
kbit/s with toll quality speech starting at 7.4 kbit/s.</p>
<p>AMR was adopted as the standard speech codec by 3GPP in October 1999 and
is now widely used in GSM[4] and UMTS. It uses link adaptation to
select from one of eight different bit rates based on link conditions.</p>
<p>AMR is also a file format for storing spoken audio using the AMR codec.
Many modern mobile telephone handsets can store short audio recordings
in the AMR format, and both free and proprietary programs exist (see
Software support) to convert between this and other formats, although
AMR is a speech format and is unlikely to give ideal results for other
audio. The common filename extension is .amr. There also exists another
storage format for AMR that is suitable for applications with more
advanced demands on the storage format, like random access or
synchronization with video. This format is the 3GPP-specified 3GP
container format based on ISO base media file format.</p>

<p>GSM Full Rate</p>
<p>Full Rate (FR or GSM-FR or GSM 06.10 or sometimes simply GSM) was the
first digital speech coding standard used in the GSM digital mobile
phone system. The bit rate of the codec is 13 kbit/s, or 1.625
bits/audio sample (often padded out to 33 bytes/20 ms or 13.2 kbit/s).
The quality of the coded speech is quite poor by modern standards, but
at the time of development (early 1990s) it was a good compromise
between computational complexity and quality, requiring only on the
order of a million additions and multiplications per second. The codec
is still widely used in networks around the world. Gradually FR will be
replaced by Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR)
standards, which provide much higher speech quality with lower bit rate.</p>

countries and territories.</p>
<p>2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog
cellular networks, and the GSM standard originally described a digital,
circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony. This
expanded over time to include data communications, first by
circuit-switched transport, then by packet data transport via GPRS
(General Packet Radio Services) and EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM

<p>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software is a
software engineering book describing software design patterns. The
book's authors are Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John
Vlissides with a foreword by Grady Booch. The book is divided into two
parts, with the first two chapters exploring the capabilities and
pitfalls of object-oriented programming, and the remaining chapters
describing 23 classic software design patterns. The book includes
examples in C++ and Smalltalk.</p>
<p>It has been influential to the field of software engineering and is
regarded as an important source for object-oriented design theory and
practice. More than 500,000 copies have been sold in English and in 13
other languages. The authors are often referred to as the Gang of Four

<p>The Gateway Control Protocol (Megaco, H.248) is an implementation of the
media gateway control protocol architecture for providing
telecommunication services across a converged internetwork consisting of
the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN) and modern
packet networks, such as the Internet. H.248 is the designation of the
recommendations developed by the ITU Telecommunication Standardization
Sector (ITU-T) and Megaco is a contraction of media gateway control
protocol used by the earliest specifications by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). The standard published in March 2013 by ITU-T is
entitled H.248.1: Gateway control protocol: Version 3.</p>
<p>Megaco/H.248 follows the guidelines published in RFC 2805 in April 2000,
entitled Media Gateway Control Protocol Architecture and Requirements.
The protocol performs the same functions as the Media Gateway Control
Protocol (MGCP), is however a formal standard while MGCP has only
informational status. Using different syntax and symbolic
representation, the two protocols are not directly interoperable. They
are both complementary to H.323 and the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) protocols.</p>
<p>H.248 was the result of collaboration of the MEGACO working group of the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the International
Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Study Group 16. The IETF
originally published the standard as RFC 3015, which was superseded by
RFC 3525. The term Megaco is the IETF designation. Megaco combines
concepts from MGCP and the Media Device Control Protocol (MDCP). MGCP
originated from a combination of the Simple Gateway Control Protocol
(SGCP) with the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC).</p>
<p>After the ITU took responsibility of the protocol maintenance, the IETF
reclassified its publications as historic in RFC 5125. The ITU has
published three versions of H.248, the most recent in September 2005.
H.248 encompasses not only the base protocol specification in H.248.1,
but many extensions defined throughout the H.248 sub-series.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="h323"><a class="header" href="#h323">H.323</a></h1>
<p>H.323 is a recommendation from the ITU Telecommunication Standardization
Sector (ITU-T) that defines the protocols to provide audio-visual
communication sessions on any packet network. The H.323 standard
addresses call signaling and control, multimedia transport and control,
and bandwidth control for point-to-point and multi-point
conferences.[1]</p>
<p>It is widely implemented[2] by voice and videoconferencing equipment
manufacturers, is used within various Internet real-time applications
such as GnuGK and NetMeeting and is widely deployed worldwide by service
providers and enterprises for both voice and video services over IP
networks.</p>
<p>It is a part of the ITU-T H.32x series of protocols, which also address
multimedia communications over ISDN, the PSTN or SS7, and 3G mobile
networks.</p>
<p>H.323 call signaling is based on the ITU-T Recommendation Q.931 protocol
and is suited for transmitting calls across networks using a mixture of
IP, PSTN, ISDN, and QSIG over ISDN. A call model, similar to the ISDN
call model, eases the introduction of IP telephony into existing
networks of ISDN-based PBX systems, including transitions to IP-based
PBXs.</p>
<p>Within the context of H.323, an IP-based PBX might be a gatekeeper or
other call control element which provides service to telephones or
videophones. Such a device may provide or facilitate both basic services
and supplementary services, such as call transfer, park, pick-up, and
hold.</p>

<p>High-Level Datalink Control</p>
<p>High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a bit-oriented code-transparent
synchronous data link layer protocol developed by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO). The original ISO standards for
HDLC are as follows:</p>
<p>ISO 3309-1979 -- Frame Structure<br />
ISO 4335-1979 -- Elements of Procedure<br />
ISO 6159-1980 -- Unbalanced Classes of Procedure<br />
ISO 6256-1981 -- Balanced Classes of Procedure<br />
The current standard for HDLC is ISO/IEC 13239:2002, which replaces all
of those standards.</p>
<p>HDLC provides both connection-oriented and connectionless service.</p>
<p>HDLC can be used for point-to-multipoint connections via the original
master-slave modes Normal Response Mode (NRM) and Asynchronous Response
Mode (ARM), but they are now rarely used; is now used almost exclusively
to connect one device to another, using Asynchronous Balanced Mode
(ABM).</p>

<p>Home Location Register</p>
<p>The home location register (HLR) is a central database that contains
details of each mobile phone subscriber that is authorized to use the
GSM core network. There can be several logical, and physical, HLRs per
public land mobile network (PLMN), though one international mobile
subscriber identity (IMSI)/MSISDN pair can be associated with only one
logical HLR (which can span several physical nodes) at a time.</p>
<p>The HLRs store details of every SIM card issued by the mobile phone
operator. Each SIM has a unique identifier called an IMSI which is the
primary key to each HLR record.</p>
<p>Another important item of data associated with the SIM are the MSISDNs,
which are the telephone numbers used by mobile phones to make and
receive calls. The primary MSISDN is the number used for making and
receiving voice calls and SMS, but it is possible for a SIM to have
other secondary MSISDNs associated with it for fax and data calls. Each
MSISDN is also a primary key to the HLR record. The HLR data is stored
for as long as a subscriber remains with the mobile phone operator.</p>
<p>Examples of other data stored in the HLR against an IMSI record is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GSM services that the subscriber has requested or been given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) settings to allow the subscriber
to access packet services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current location of subscriber (VLR and serving GPRS support
node/SGSN).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call divert settings applicable for each associated MSISDN.</p>
<p>The HLR is a system which directly receives and processes MAP
transactions and messages from elements in the GSM network, for
example, the location update messages received as mobile phones roam
around.</p>

1998. There is no RFC for version 2 of the protocol.</p>
<p>The protocol establishes an association between gateways in order to
achieve default gateway failover if the primary gateway becomes
inaccessible. HSRP gateways send multicast hello messages to other
gateways to notify them of their priorities (which gateway is preferred)
and current status (active or standby).<br />

<p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</p>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for
distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems.[1]
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks)
between nodes containing text. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or
transfer hypertext.</p>
<p>Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989.
Standards development of HTTP was coordinated by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
culminating in the publication of a series of Requests for Comments
(RFCs). The first definition of HTTP/1.1, the version of HTTP in common
use, occurred in RFC 2068 in 1997, although this was made obsolete by
RFC 2616 in 1999 and then again by the RFC 7230 family of RFCs in 2014.</p>
<p>A later version, the successor HTTP/2, was standardized in 2015, and is
now supported by major web servers and browsers over TLS using ALPN
extension where TLS 1.2 or newer is required</p>
<p>Example session<br />
Below is a sample conversation between an HTTP client and an HTTP server
running on <a href="http://www.example.com/">www.example.com</a>, port 80. As

<p>HTTP Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely
used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted
using Transport Layer Security (TLS), or formerly, its predecessor,
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also often
referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.</p>
<p>The principal motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the accessed
website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged
data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks.
The bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and
server protects against eavesdropping and tampering of the
communication. In practice, this provides a reasonable assurance that
one is communicating without interference by attackers with the website
that one intended to communicate with, as opposed to an impostor.</p>
<p>Historically, HTTPS connections were primarily used for payment
transactions on the World Wide Web, e-mail and for sensitive
transactions in corporate information systems. Since 2018, HTTPS is used
more often by webusers than the original non-secure HTTP, primarily to
protect page authenticity on all types of websites; secure accounts; and
keep user communications, identity, and web browsing private.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="half-duplex"><a class="header" href="#half-duplex">Half Duplex</a></h1>
<p>In a half-duplex system, both parties can communicate with each other,
but not simultaneously; the communication is one direction at a time. An
example of a half-duplex device is a walkie-talkie two-way radio that
has a &quot;push-to-talk&quot; button; when the local user wants to speak to the
remote person they push this button, which turns on the transmitter but
turns off the receiver, so they cannot hear the remote person. To listen
to the other person they release the button, which turns on the receiver
but turns off the transmitter.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hash-function"><a class="header" href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h1>
<p>hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary
size to data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are
called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. Hash
functions are often used in combination with a hash table, a common data
structure used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash
functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated
records in a large file. One such application is finding similar
stretches in DNA sequences. They are also useful in cryptography. A
cryptographic hash function allows one to easily verify that some input
data maps to a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown, it is
deliberately difficult to reconstruct it (or any equivalent
alternatives) by knowing the stored hash value. This is
used for assuring integrity of transmitted data, and is the building
block for HMACs, which provide message authentication.</p>
<p>Hash functions are related to (and often confused with) checksums, check
digits, fingerprints, lossy compression, randomization functions,
error-correcting codes, and ciphers. Although the concepts overlap to
some extent, each one has its own uses and requirements and is designed
and optimized differently. The HashKeeper database maintained by the
American National Drug Intelligence Center, for instance, is more aptly
described as a catalogue of file fingerprints than of hash values.<br />

<p>An Ethernet hub, active hub, network hub, repeater hub, multiport
repeater, or simply hub is a network hardware device for connecting
multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single
network segment. It has multiple input/output (I/O) ports, in which a
signal introduced at the input of any port appears at the output of
every port except the original incoming. A hub works at the physical
layer (layer 1) of the OSI model. A repeater hub also participates in
collision detection, forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects
a collision. In addition to standard 8P8C (&quot;RJ45&quot;) ports, some hubs may
also come with a BNC or an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) connector to
allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.</p>
<p>Hubs are now largely obsolete, having been replaced by network switches
except in very old installations or specialized applications. As of
2011, connecting network segments by repeaters or hubs is deprecated by
IEEE 802.3.</p>

<p>Basic Rate Interface</p>
<p>Basic Rate Interface (BRI, 2B+D, 2B1D) or Basic Rate Access is an
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) configuration intended
primarily for use in subscriber lines similar to those that have long
been used for voice-grade telephone service. As such, an ISDN BRI
connection can use the existing telephone infrastructure at a business.</p>
<p>The BRI configuration provides 2 data (bearer) channels (B channels) at
64 kbit/s each and 1 control (delta) channel (D channel) at 16 kbit/s.
The B channels are used for voice or user data, and the D channel is
used for any combination of data, control/signaling, and X.25 packet
networking. The 2 B channels can be aggregated by channel bonding
providing a total data rate of 128 kbit/s. The BRI ISDN service is
commonly installed for residential or small business service (ISDN PABX)
in many countries.</p>
<p>In contrast to the BRI, the Primary Rate Interface (PRI) configuration
provides more B channels and operates at a higher bit rate.</p>

<p>Information Assurance</p>
<p>Information assurance (IA) is the practice of assuring information and
managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission
of information or data and the systems and processes used for those
purposes. Information assurance includes protection of the integrity,
availability, authenticity, non-repudiation and confidentiality of user
data. It uses physical, technical and administrative controls to
accomplish these tasks. While focused predominantly on information in
digital form, the full range of IA encompasses not only digital but also
analog or physical form. These protections apply to data in transit,
both physical and electronic forms as well as data at rest in various
types of physical and electronic storage facilities. Information

<p>Interactive Connectivity Establishment</p>
<p>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a technique used in
computer networking to find ways for two computers to talk to each other
as directly as possible in peer-to-peer networking. This is most
commonly used for interactive media such as Voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP), peer-to-peer communications, video, and instant messaging. In
such applications, you want to avoid communicating through a central
server (which would slow down communication, and be expensive), but
direct communication between client applications on the Internet is very
tricky due to network address translators (NATs), firewalls, and other
network barriers.</p>
<p>ICE is developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force MMUSIC working
group and is published as RFC 5245, which has obsoleted RFC 4091</p>

<p>Internet Control Message Protocol</p>
<p>The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supporting protocol in
the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, including
routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating,
for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or
router could not be reached. ICMP differs from transport protocols such
as TCP and UDP in that it is not typically used to exchange data between
systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network applications
(with the exception of some diagnostic tools like ping and traceroute).</p>

<p>Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (for IPv6)</p>
<p>Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) is the
implementation of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). ICMPv6 is defined in RFC 4443.[1]
ICMPv6 is an integral part of IPv6 and performs error reporting and
diagnostic functions (e.g., ping), and has a framework for extensions to
implement future changes.</p>
<p>Several extensions have been published, defining new ICMPv6 message
types as well as new options for existing ICMPv6 message types. Neighbor
Discovery Protocol (NDP) is a node discovery protocol in IPv6 which
replaces and enhances functions of ARP.[2] Secure Neighbor Discovery
(SEND) is an extension of NDP with extra security. Multicast Listener
Discovery (MLD) is used by IPv6 routers for discovering multicast
listeners on a directly attached link, much like Internet Group
Management Protocol (IGMP) is used in IPv4. Multicast Router Discovery
(MRD) allows discovery of multicast routers.</p>

<p>Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB; known as &quot;mac-in-mac&quot;) is a set of
architecture and protocols for routing over a provider's network
allowing interconnection of multiple Provider Bridge Networks without
losing each customer's individually defined VLANs. It was initially
created by Nortel before being submitted to the IEEE 802.1 committee for
standardization. The final standard was approved by the IEEE in June
2008 as IEEE 802.1ah-2008 and has been integrated into IEEE 802.1Q-2011.</p>
<p>The idea of PBB is to offer complete separation of customer and provider
domains. For this purpose, a new Ethernet header has been defined. This
header may take multiple different forms, but the main components of the
header are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backbone component, that has:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backbone destination address (B-DA) (six bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backbone source address (B-SA) (six bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherType 0x88A8 (two bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B-TAG/B-VID (two bytes), this is the backbone VLAN indicator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service encapsulation, that has:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherType 0x88E7 (two bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flags that contain priority, Drop Eligible Indicator (DEI) and No
Customer Address (NCA) indication (e.g. OAM frames).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I-SID, the service identifier (three bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original customer frame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer destination address (six bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer source address (six bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherType 0x8100 (two bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer VLAN identifier (two bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherType (e.g. 0x0800)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer payload</p>
<p>PBB defines a 48 bit B-DA and 48 bit B-SA to indicate the backbone
source and destination MAC addresses. It also defines a 12 bit B-VID
(backbone VLAN ID) and 24 bit I-SID (Service Instance VLAN ID). The
bridges in the PBB domain switch based on the B-VID and B-DA values,
which contain 60 bits total. Bridges learn based on the B-SA and
ingress port value and hence is completely unaware of the customer
MAC addresses. I-SID allows distinguishing the services within a PBB
domain.</p>
<p>PBB is the foundation for the IEEE 802.1Qay PBB-TE standard, which
was standardized in 2009.</p>
<p>PBB is sometimes referred to as Mac-in-Mac.</p>

<p>Interior Gateway Protocol</p>
<p>An interior gateway protocol (IGP) is a type of protocol used for
exchanging routing information between gateways (commonly routers)
within an autonomous system (for example, a system of corporate local

network-layer protocols like IP.</p>
<p>Interior gateway protocols can be divided into two categories:
distance-vector routing protocols and link-state routing protocols.
Specific examples of IGPs include Open Shortest Path First (OSPF),
Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Intermediate System to Intermediate
System (IS-IS) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).</p>

<p>Interior Gateway Routing Protocol</p>
<p>Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) is a distance vector interior
gateway protocol (IGP) developed by Cisco. It is used by routers to
exchange routing data within an autonomous system.</p>
<p>IGRP is a proprietary protocol. IGRP was created in part to overcome the
limitations of RIP (maximum hop count of only 15, and a single routing
metric) when used within large networks. IGRP supports multiple metrics
for each route, including bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability; to
compare two routes these metrics are combined together into a single
metric, using a formula which can be adjusted through the use of pre-set
constants. By default, the IGRP composite metric is a sum of the segment
delays and the lowest segment bandwidth. The maximum configurable hop
count of IGRP-routed packets is 255 (default 100), and routing updates
are broadcast every 90 seconds (by default). IGRP uses protocol number 9
for communication.</p>

<p>Internet Message Access Protocol</p>
<p>In computing, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet
standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from
a mail server over a TCP/IP connection. IMAP is defined by RFC 3501.</p>
<p>IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an
email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave
messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. An IMAP
server typically listens on port number 143. IMAP over SSL (IMAPS) is
assigned the port number 993.</p>
<p>Virtually all modern e-mail clients and servers support IMAP. IMAP and
the earlier POP3 (Post Office Protocol) are the two most prevalent
standard protocols for email retrieval, with many webmail service
providers such as Gmail, Outlook.com and Yahoo! Mail also providing
support for either IMAP or POP3.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ims"><a class="header" href="#ims">IMS</a></h1>
<p>IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem</p>
<p>The IP Multimedia Subsystem or IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem
(IMS) is an architectural framework for delivering IP multimedia
services. Historically, mobile phones have provided voice call services
over a circuit-switched-style network, rather than strictly over an IP
packet-switched network. Alternative methods of delivering voice (VoIP)
or other multimedia services have become available on smartphones, but
they have not become standardized across the industry. IMS is an
architectural framework to provide such standardization.</p>
<p>IMS was originally designed by the wireless standards body 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), as a part of the vision for
evolving mobile networks beyond GSM. Its original formulation (3GPP
Rel-5) represented an approach for delivering Internet services over
GPRS. This vision was later updated by 3GPP, 3GPP2 and ETSI TISPAN by
requiring support of networks other than GPRS, such as Wireless LAN,
CDMA2000 and fixed lines.</p>
<p>IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible, e.g., the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP). According to the 3GPP, IMS is not intended to
standardize applications, but rather to aid the access of multimedia and
voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals, i.e., to create
a form of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). This is done by having a
horizontal control layer that isolates the access network from the
service layer. From a logical architecture perspective, services need
not have their own control functions, as the control layer is a common
horizontal layer. However, in implementation this does not necessarily
map into greater reduced cost and complexity.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="imsi"><a class="header" href="#imsi">IMSI</a></h1>
<p>International Mobile Subscriber Identity</p>
<p>The International Mobile Subscriber Identity or IMSI is used to identify
the user of a cellular network and is a unique identification associated
with all cellular networks. It is stored as a 64 bit field and is sent
by the phone to the network. It is also used for acquiring other details
of the mobile in the home location register (HLR) or as locally copied
in the visitor location register. To prevent eavesdroppers identifying
and tracking the subscriber on the radio interface, the IMSI is sent as
rarely as possible and a randomly generated TMSI is sent instead.</p>
<p>The IMSI is used in any mobile network that interconnects with other
networks. For GSM, UMTS and LTE networks, this number was provisioned in
the SIM card and for cdmaOne and CDMA2000 networks, in the phone
directly or in the R-UIM card (the CDMA equivalent of the SIM card).
Both cards have been superseded by the UICC.</p>
<p>An IMSI is usually presented as a 15 digit number but can be shorter.
For example, MTN South Africa's old IMSIs that are still being used in
the market are shown as 14 digits. The first 3 digits are the mobile
country code (MCC), which are followed by the mobile network code (MNC),
either 2 digits (European standard) or 3 digits (North American
standard). The length of the MNC depends on the value of the MCC, and it
is recommended that the length is uniform within a MCC area. The
remaining digits are the mobile subscription identification number
(MSIN) within the network's customer base (mostly 10 or 9 digits
depending on the MNC length).</p>
<p>The IMSI conforms to the ITU E.212 numbering standard.</p>

<p>Intelligent Network</p>
<p>The Intelligent Network (IN) is the standard network architecture
specified in the ITU-T Q.1200 series recommendations. It is intended for
fixed as well as mobile telecom networks. It allows operators to
differentiate themselves by providing value-added services in addition
to the standard telecom services such as PSTN, ISDN on fixed networks,
and GSM services on mobile phones or other mobile devices.</p>
<p>The intelligence is provided by network nodes on the service layer,
distinct from the switching layer of the core network, as opposed to
solutions based on intelligence in the core switches or equipment. The
IN nodes are typically owned by telecommunications service providers
such as a telephone company or mobile phone operator.</p>
<p>IN is supported by the Signaling System #7 (SS7) protocol between
network switching centers and other network nodes owned by network
operators.</p>

<p>Intrusion Prevention Services</p>
<p>An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application
that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy
violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported
either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security
information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines
outputs from multiple sources, and uses alarm filtering techniques to
distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.</p>
<p>While there are several types of IDS, ranging in scope from single
computers to large networks,[1]. the most common classifications are
network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion
detection systems (HIDS). A system that monitors important operating
system files is an example of a HIDS, while a system that analyzes
incoming network traffic is an example of a NIDS. It is also possible to
classify IDS by detection approach: the most well-known variants are
signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware)
and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of &quot;good&quot;
traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Some IDS have the
ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response
capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention
system.</p>

<p>IP Security</p>
<p>In computing, Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a secure network
protocol suite of IPv4 that authenticates and encrypts the packets of
data sent over an IPv4 network. Because of the complexity or immaturity
of the IP security protocols, the initial IPv4 was developed without or
barely with security protocols such that the IP version was incomplete,
open or left for further research development. IPsec includes protocols
for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning
of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to use during the
session. IPsec can protect data flows between a pair of hosts
(host-to-host), between a pair of security gateways
(network-to-network), or between a security gateway and a host
(network-to-host).[1] Internet Protocol security (IPsec) uses
cryptographic security services to protect communications over Internet
Protocol (IP) networks. IPsec supports network-level peer
authentication, data-origin authentication, data integrity, data
confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection.</p>
<p>As a part of the IPv4 enhancement, IPsec is a layer 3 OSI model or
Internet Layer for an end-to-end security scheme operating in the
Internet Protocol Suite in version 4, while some other Internet security
systems in widespread use are above the layer 3, such as Transport Layer
Security (TLS) and Secure Shell (SSH), operate in the upper layers at
the Transport Layer (TLS) and the Application layer (SSH). IPsec can
automatically secure applications at the IP layer.</p>

<p>Internet Protocol television</p>
<p>Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is the delivery of television
content over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. This is in contrast to
delivery through traditional terrestrial, satellite, and cable
television formats. Unlike downloaded media, IPTV offers the ability to
stream the source media continuously. As a result, a client media player
can begin playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately.
This is known as streaming media.</p>
<p>Although IPTV uses the Internet protocol it is not limited to television
streamed from the Internet, (Internet television). IPTV is widely
deployed in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-speed
access channels into end-user premises via set-top boxes or other
customer-premises equipment. IPTV is also used for media delivery around
corporate and private networks. IPTV in the telecommunications arena is
notable for its ongoing standardisation process (e.g., European
Telecommunications Standards Institute).</p>
<p>IPTV services may be classified into three main groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Live television and live media, with or without related
interactivity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time-shifted media: e.g. catch-up TV (replays a TV show that was
broadcast hours or days ago), start-over TV (replays the current TV
show from its beginning);</p>

<p>Internet Protocol version 6</p>
<p>Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the Internet
Protocol (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based
internetworking methods in the Internet, and was the first version
deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. It still routes most
Internet traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of a successor
protocol, IPv6. IPv4 is described in IETF publication RFC 791 (September
1981), replacing an earlier definition (RFC 760, January 1980).</p>
<p>IPv4 is a connectionless protocol for use on packet-switched networks.
It operates on a best effort delivery model, in that it does not
guarantee delivery, nor does it assure proper sequencing or avoidance of
duplicate delivery. These aspects, including data integrity, are
addressed by an upper layer transport protocol, such as the Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP).<br />
<img src="Glossary/i/./images/15008390.png?width=480" alt="" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ipv6"><a class="header" href="#ipv6">IPv6</a></h1>
<p>Internet Protocol version 4</p>
<p>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the
Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an
identification and location system for computers on networks and routes
traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem
of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4. IPv6
became a Draft Standard in December 1998, and became an Internet
Standard on 14 July 2017.</p>
<p>Every device on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address for
identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the
Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that
far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4
address space had available. By 1998, the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a 128-bit
address, theoretically allowing 2128, or approximately 3.4×1038
addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are
reserved for special use or completely excluded from use. The total
number of possible IPv6 addresses is more than 7.9×1028 times as many as
IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses and provides approximately 4.3 billion
addresses. The two protocols are not designed to be interoperable,
complicating the transition to IPv6. However, several IPv6 transition
mechanisms have been devised to permit communication between IPv4 and
IPv6 hosts.</p>
<p>IPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger
addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address
allocation methods that facilitate route aggregation across the
Internet, and thus limit the expansion of routing tables. The use of
multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional
optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security,
and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the
protocol.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal
digits with the groups being separated by colons, for example
2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, but methods to abbreviate this
full notation exist.<br />

<p>Integrated Services Digital Network</p>
<p>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a set of communication
standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data,

switched telephone network. It was first defined in 1988 in the CCITT
red book.[1] Prior to ISDN, the telephone system was viewed as a way
to transport voice, with some special services available for data. The
key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same
lines, adding features that were not available in the classic telephone
system. The ISDN standards define several kinds of access interfaces,
such as Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI),
Narrowband ISDN (N-ISDN), and Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN).</p>
<p>ISDN is a circuit-switched telephone network system, which also provides
access to packet switched networks, designed to allow digital
transmission of voice and data over ordinary telephone copper wires,
resulting in potentially better voice quality than an analog phone can
provide. It offers circuit-switched connections (for either voice or
data), and packet-switched connections (for data), in increments of 64
kilobit/s. In some countries, ISDN found major market application for
Internet access, in which ISDN typically provides a maximum of 128
kbit/s bandwidth in both upstream and downstream directions. Channel
bonding can achieve a greater data rate; typically the ISDN B-channels
of three or four BRIs (six to eight 64 kbit/s channels) are bonded.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="isup"><a class="header" href="#isup">ISUP</a></h1>
<p>The ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) User Part or ISUP is part
of Signaling System No. 7 (SS7), which is used to set up telephone calls
in the public switched telephone network (PSTN). It is specified by the
ITU-T as part of the Q.76x series.</p>
<p>When a telephone call is set up from one subscriber to another, several
telephone exchanges could be involved, possibly across international
boundaries. To allow a call to be set up correctly, where ISUP is
supported, a switch will signal call-related information like called
party number to the next switch in the network using ISUP messages.</p>
<p>The telephone exchanges may be connected via E1 or T1 trunks which
transport the speech from the calls. These trunks are divided into 64
kbit/s timeslots, and one timeslot can carry exactly one call.
Regardless of what facilities are used to interconnect switches, each
circuit between two switches is uniquely identified by a circuit
identification code (CIC) that is included in the ISUP messages. The
exchange uses this information along with the received signaling
information (especially the called party number) to determine which
inbound and outbound circuits should be connected together to provide an
end to end speech path.</p>
<p>In addition to call related information, ISUP is also used to exchange
status information for, and permit management of, the available
circuits. In the case of no outbound circuit being available on a
particular exchange, a release message is sent back to the preceding
switches in the chain.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="itil"><a class="header" href="#itil">ITIL</a></h1>
<p>TIL (formerly an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure
Library) is a set of detailed practices for IT service management (ITSM)
that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business. In its
current form (known as ITIL 2011), ITIL is published as a series of five
core volumes, each of which covers a different ITSM lifecycle stage.
Although ITIL underpins ISO/IEC 20000 (previously BS 15000), the
International Service Management Standard for IT service management,
there are some differences between the ISO 20000 standard, ICT Standard
by IFGICT and the ITIL framework.</p>
<p>ITIL describes processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists which are
not organization-specific or technology-specific, but can be applied by
an organization for establishing integration with the organization's
strategy, delivering value, and maintaining a minimum level of
competency. It allows the organization to establish a baseline from
which it can plan, implement, and measure. It is used to demonstrate
compliance and to measure improvement.</p>

is responsible for issues that concern information and communication
technologies.[1]</p>
<p>The ITU coordinates the shared global use of the radio spectrum,
promotes international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, works
to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world, and
assists in the development and coordination of worldwide technical
standards. The ITU is active in areas including broadband Internet,
latest-generation wireless technologies, aeronautical and maritime
navigation, radio astronomy, satellite-based meteorology, convergence in
fixed-mobile phone, Internet access, data, voice, TV broadcasting, and
next-generation networks. The agency also organizes worldwide and
regional exhibitions and forums, such as ITU Telecom World, bringing
together representatives of government and the telecommunications and
ICT industry to exchange ideas, knowledge and technology.</p>

<p>The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of
communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer
networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational
protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and
the Internet Protocol (IP). It is occasionally known as the Department
of Defense (DoD) model because the development of the networking method
was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.</p>
<p>The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication
specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted,
routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four
abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to
the scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, the layers are
the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains
within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing
internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer,
handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer,
providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.</p>
<p>Technical standards specifying the Internet protocol suite and many of
its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). The Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a
more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="interpreted-language"><a class="header" href="#interpreted-language">Interpreted Language</a></h1>
<p>An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most
of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without
previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The
interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement
into a sequence of one or more subroutines, and then into another
language (often machine code).</p>
<p>The terms interpreted language and compiled language are not well
defined because, in theory, any programming language can be either
interpreted or compiled. In modern programming language implementation,
it is increasingly popular for a platform to provide both options.</p>
<p>Interpreted languages can also be contrasted with machine languages.
Functionally, both execution and interpretation mean the same thing ---
fetching the next instruction/statement from the program and executing
it. Although interpreted byte code is additionally identical to machine
code in form and has an assembler representation, the term &quot;interpreted&quot;
is practically reserved for &quot;software processed&quot; languages (by virtual
machine or emulator) on top of the native (i.e. hardware) processor.</p>
<p>In principle, programs in many languages may be compiled or interpreted,
emulated or executed natively, so this designation is applied solely
based on common implementation practice, rather than representing an
essential property of a language.</p>
<p>Many languages have been implemented using both compilers and
interpreters, including BASIC, C, Lisp, Pascal, and Python. Java and C#
are compiled into bytecode, the virtual-machine-friendly interpreted
language. Lisp implementations can freely mix interpreted and compiled
code.</p>

<p>An issue tracking system (also ITS, trouble ticket system, support
ticket, request management or incident ticket system) is a computer
software package that manages and maintains lists of issues, as needed
by an organization. Issue tracking systems are commonly used in an
organization's customer support call center to create, update, and
resolve reported customer issues, or even issues reported by that
organization's other employees. A support ticket should include vital
information for the account involved and the issue encountered. An issue
tracking system often also contains a knowledge base containing
information on each customer, resolutions to common problems, and other
such data. An issue tracking system is similar to a &quot;bugtracker&quot;, and
often, a software company will sell both, and some bugtrackers are
capable of being used as an issue tracking system, and vice versa.
Consistent use of an issue or bug tracking system is considered one of
the &quot;hallmarks of a good software team&quot;.</p>
<p>A ticket element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report
on a particular problem, its status, and other relevant data. They are
commonly created in a help desk or call center environment and almost
always have a unique reference number, also known as a case, issue or
call log number which is used to allow the user or help staff to quickly
locate, add to or communicate the status of the user's issue or request.</p>

<p>Primary Rate Interface</p>
<p>The Primary Rate Interface (PRI) is a telecommunications interface
standard used on an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) for
carrying multiple DS0 voice and data transmissions between the network
and a user.</p>
<p>PRI is the standard for providing telecommunication services to
enterprises and offices. It is based on T-carrier (T1) transmission in
the US, Canada, and Japan, while the E-carrier (E1) is common in Europe
and Australia. The T1 line consists of 23 bearer (B) channels and one
data (D) channel for control purposes, for a total bandwidth of
24x64-kbit/s or 1.544 Mbit/s. The E1 carrier provides 30 B- and two
D-channels for a bandwidth of 2.048 Mbit/s. The first timeslot on the E1
is used for synchronization purposes and is not considered to be a B- or
D-channel. The D-channel typically uses timeslot 16 on an E1, while it
is timeslot 24 for a T1. Fewer active bearer channels, sometimes called
user channels, may be used in fractional T1 or E1 services.</p>

<p>Internet Low Bitrate Codec</p>
<p>Internet Low Bitrate Codec (iLBC) is an open source royalty-free
narrowband speech audio coding format codec and reference
implementation, developed by Global IP Solutions (GIPS) formerly Global
IP Sound. It was formerly freeware with limitations on commercial use,
but since 2011 it is available under a free software/open source
(3-clause BSD license) license as a part of the open source WebRTC
project. It is suitable for VoIP applications, streaming audio, archival
and messaging. The algorithm is a version of block-independent linear
predictive coding, with the choice of data frame lengths of 20 and 30
milliseconds. The encoded blocks have to be encapsulated in a suitable
protocol for transport, usually the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).</p>
<p>iLBC handles lost frames through graceful speech quality degradation.
Lost frames often occur in connection with lost or delayed IP packets.
Ordinary low-bitrate codecs exploit dependencies between speech frames,
which cause errors to propagate when packets are lost or delayed. In
contrast, iLBC-encoded speech frames are independent and so this problem
will not occur.</p>

serializable value). It is a very common data format
used for asynchronous browser--server communication, including as a
replacement for XML in some AJAX-style systems.</p>
<p>JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="java"><a class="header" href="#java">Java</a></h1>
<p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is
concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to
have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to
let application developers &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; (WORA), meaning
that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically
compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most
popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web
applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally
developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been
acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component
of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its
syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either
of them.</p>
<p>The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual
machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under
proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the
specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its
Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also
developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as
the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard
libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="javascript"><a class="header" href="#javascript">Javascript</a></h1>
<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted
programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as
dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.</p>
<p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies
of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus
is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
use it,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
engine to execute it.</p>
<p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and
prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with
text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the
DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as
networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the
host environment in which it is embedded.</p>
<p>Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript
engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including
server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such
as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that
make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications,
including desktop widgets.</p>
<p>Although there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and
Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard
libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design;
JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and
Scheme.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="jitter-buffer"><a class="header" href="#jitter-buffer">Jitter buffer</a></h1>
<p>Jitter buffers or de-jitter buffers are used to counter jitter
introduced by queuing in packet switched networks so that a continuous
playout of audio (or video) transmitted over the network can be ensured.
The maximum jitter that can be countered by a de-jitter buffer is equal
to the buffering delay introduced before starting the play-out of the
mediastream. In the context of packet-switched networks, the term packet
delay variation is often preferred over jitter.</p>
<p>Some systems use sophisticated delay-optimal de-jitter buffers that are
capable of adapting the buffering delay to changing network jitter
characteristics. These are known as adaptive de-jitter buffers and the
adaptation logic is based on the jitter estimates computed from the
arrival characteristics of the media packets. Adaptive de-jittering
involves introducing discontinuities in the media play-out, which may

usually carried out for audio play-outs that feature a VAD/DTX encoded
audio, that allows the lengths of the silence periods to be adjusted,
thus minimizing the perceptual impact of the adaptation.</p>
<p>Packet jitter in computer networks<br />
In the context of computer networks, jitter is the variation in latency
as measured in the variability over time of the packet latency across a
network. A network with constant latency has no variation (or jitter).
Packet jitter is expressed as an average of the deviation from the
network mean latency. However, for this use, the term is imprecise. The
standards-based term is &quot;packet delay variation&quot; (PDV). PDV is an
important quality of service factor in assessment of network
performance.</p>
<p>Burst transmission or burstiness, i.e. transmitting a burst of traffic
at a high rate followed by an interval or period of lower or zero rate
transmission, may also be seen as a form of jitter, as it represents a
deviation from the average transmission rate. However, unlike the jitter
caused by variation in latency, transmitting in bursts is commonly seen
a desirable feature, e.g. in variable bitrate transmissions.
Usage/Network Parameter Control (UPC and NPC), as implemented in ATM
networks, allows both a Maximum Burst Size (MBS) parameter on the
average or Sustained Cell Rate (SCR), and a Cell Delay Variation
tolerance (CDVt) on the Peak Cell Rate (PCR) at which the bursts are
transmitted. This MBS can be derived from or used to derive the maximum
variation between the arrival time of traffic in the bursts from the
time it would arrive at the SCR, i.e. a jitter about that SCR.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="jitter"><a class="header" href="#jitter">Jitter</a></h1>
<p>In electronics and telecommunications, jitter is the deviation from true
periodicity of a presumably periodic signal, often in relation to a
reference clock signal. In clock recovery applications it is called
timing jitter. Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in
the design of almost all communications links.</p>
<p>Jitter can be quantified in the same terms as all time-varying signals,
e.g., root mean square (RMS), or peak-to-peak displacement. Also like
other time-varying signals, jitter can be expressed in terms of spectral
density.</p>
<p>Jitter period is the interval between two times of maximum effect (or
minimum effect) of a signal characteristic that varies regularly with
time. Jitter frequency, the more commonly quoted figure, is its inverse.
ITU-T G.810 classifies jitter frequencies below 10 Hz as wander and
frequencies at or above 10 Hz as jitter.</p>
<p>Jitter may be caused by electromagnetic interference and crosstalk with
carriers of other signals. Jitter can cause a display monitor to
flicker, affect the performance of processors in personal computers,
introduce clicks or other undesired effects in audio signals, and cause
loss of transmitted data between network devices. The amount of
tolerable jitter depends on the affected application.<br />

<p>Key Performance Indicator</p>
<p>A performance indicator or key performance indicator (KPI) is a type of
performance measurement. KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or
of a particular activity (such as projects, programs, products and other
initiatives) in which it engages.</p>
<p>Often success is simply the repeated, periodic achievement of some
levels of operational goal (e.g. zero defects, 10/10 customer
satisfaction, etc.), and sometimes success is defined in terms of making
progress toward strategic goals. Accordingly, choosing the right KPIs
relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the
organization.[citation needed] What is deemed important often depends
on the department measuring the performance -- e.g. the KPIs useful to
finance will differ from the KPIs assigned to sales.</p>
<p>Since there is a need to understand well what is important, various
techniques to assess the present state of the business, and its key
activities, are associated with the selection of performance indicators.
These assessments often lead to the identification of potential
improvements, so performance indicators are routinely associated with
'performance improvement' initiatives. A very common way to choose KPIs
is to apply a management framework such as the balanced scorecard.</p>

<p>Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol that works on the

to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. The protocol
was named after the character Kerberos (or Cerberus) from Greek
mythology, the ferocious three-headed guard dog of Hades. Its designers
aimed it primarily at a client--server model and it provides mutual
authentication---both the user and the server verify each other's
identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping
and replay attacks.</p>
<p>Kerberos builds on symmetric key cryptography and requires a trusted
third party, and optionally may use public-key cryptography during
certain phases of authentication. Kerberos uses UDP port 88 by default.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="kernel"><a class="header" href="#kernel">Kernel</a></h1>
<p>The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's
operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.
On most systems, it is one of the first programs loaded on start-up
(after the bootloader). It handles the rest of start-up as well as
input/output requests from software, translating them into
data-processing instructions for the central processing unit. It handles
memory and peripherals like keyboards, monitors, printers, and speakers.</p>
<p>The critical code of the kernel is usually loaded into a separate area
of memory, which is protected from access by application programs or
other, less critical parts of the operating system. The kernel performs
its tasks, such as running processes, managing hardware devices such as
the hard disk, and handling interrupts, in this protected kernel space.
In contrast, everything a user does is in user space: writing text in a
text editor, running programs in a GUI, etc. This separation prevents
user data and kernel data from interfering with each other and causing
instability and slowness, as well as preventing malfunctioning
application programs from crashing the entire operating system.</p>
<p>The kernel's interface is a low-level abstraction layer. When a process
makes requests of the kernel, it is called a system call. Kernel designs
differ in how they manage these system calls and resources. A monolithic
kernel runs all the operating system instructions in the same address
space for speed. A microkernel runs most processes in user
space, for modularity.<br />

<p>Layer 1</p>
<p>In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the physical layer
or layer 1 is the first and lowest layer. This layer may be implemented
by a PHY chip.</p>
<p>The physical layer consists of the electronic circuit transmission
technologies of a network. It is a fundamental layer underlying the
higher level functions in a network. Due to the plethora of available
hardware technologies with widely varying characteristics, this is
perhaps the most complex layer in the OSI architecture.</p>
<p>The physical layer defines the means of transmitting raw bits rather
than logical data packets over a physical data link connecting network
nodes. The bitstream may be grouped into code words or symbols and
converted to a physical signal that is transmitted over a transmission
medium. The physical layer provides an electrical, mechanical, and
procedural interface to the transmission medium. The shapes and
properties of the electrical connectors, the frequencies to broadcast
on, the line code to use and similar low-level parameters, are specified
here.<br />

<p>Layer 2</p>
<p>The data link layer, or layer 2, is the second layer of the seven-layer
OSI model of computer networking. This layer is the protocol layer that
transfers data between adjacent network nodes in a wide area network
(WAN) or between nodes on the same local area network (LAN) segment. The
data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer
data between network entities and might provide the means to detect and
possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer.</p>
<p>The data link layer is concerned with local delivery of frames between
nodes on the same level of the network. Data-link frames, as these
protocol data units are called, do not cross the boundaries of a local
network. Inter-network routing and global addressing are higher-layer
functions, allowing data-link protocols to focus on local delivery,
addressing, and media arbitration. This way, the data link layer is
analogous to a neighborhood traffic cop; it endeavors to arbitrate
between parties contending for access to a medium, without concern for
their ultimate destination. When devices attempt to use a medium
simultaneously, frame collisions occur. Data-link protocols specify how
devices detect and recover from such collisions, and may provide
mechanisms to reduce or prevent them.</p>
<p>Examples of data link protocols are Ethernet for local area networks
(multi-node), the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), HDLC and ADCCP for
point-to-point (dual-node) connections. In the Internet Protocol Suite
(TCP/IP), the data link layer functionality is contained within the link
layer, the lowest layer of the descriptive model.<br />

<p>Layer 2 Virtual Private Network</p>
<p>A Layer 2 MPLS VPN is a term in computer networking. It is a method that
Internet service providers use to segregate their network for their
customers, to allow them to transmit data over an IP network. This is
often sold as a service to businesses.</p>
<p>Layer 2 VPNs are a type of Virtual Private Network (VPN) that uses MPLS
labels to transport data. The communication occurs between routers that
are known as Provider Edge routers (PEs), as they sit on the edge of the
provider's network, next to the customer's network.</p>
<p>Internet providers who have an existing Layer 2 network (such as ATM or
Frame Relay) may choose to use these VPNs instead of the other common
MPLS VPN, Layer 3. There is no one IETF standard for Layer 2 MPLS VPNs.
Instead, two methodologies may be used. Both methods use a standard MPLS
header to encapsulate data. However, they differ in their signaling
protocols.</p>

protocols are then run through the L2TP tunnel. To facilitate this, an
L2TP session (or 'call') is established within the tunnel for each
higher-level protocol such as PPP. Either the LAC or LNS may initiate
sessions. The traffic for each session is isolated by L2TP, so it is
possible to set up multiple virtual networks across a single tunnel. MTU
should be considered when implementing L2TP.<br />

<p>Label Switched Path</p>
<p>A label-switched path (LSP) is a path through an MPLS network, set up by
a signaling protocol such as LDP, RSVP-TE, BGP (or the now deprecated
CR-LDP). The path is set up based on criteria in the FEC.</p>
<p>The path begins at a label edge router (LER), which makes a decision on
which label to prefix to a packet, based on the appropriate FEC. It then
forwards the packet along to the next router in the path, which swaps
the packet's outer label for another label, and forwards it to the next
router. The last router in the path removes the label from the packet
and forwards the packet based on the header of its next layer, for
example IPv4. Due to the forwarding of packets through an LSP being
opaque to higher network layers, an LSP is also sometimes referred to as
an MPLS tunnel.</p>
<p>The router which first prefixes the MPLS header to a packet is called an
ingress router. The last router in an LSP, which pops the label from the
packet, is called an egress router. Routers in between, which need only
swap labels, are called transit routers or label switch routers (LSRs).</p>
<p>Note that LSPs are unidirectional; they enable a packet to be label
switched through the MPLS network from one endpoint to another. Since
bidirectional communication is typically desired, the aforementioned
dynamic signaling protocols can set up an LSP in the other direction to
compensate for this.</p>

<p>Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is a standard for high-speed wireless
communication for mobile devices and data terminals, based on the
GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies. It increases the capacity and speed
using a different radio interface together with core network
improvements. The standard is developed by the 3GPP (3rd Generation
Partnership Project) and is specified in its Release 8 document series,
with minor enhancements described in Release 9. LTE is the upgrade path
for carriers with both GSM/UMTS networks and CDMA2000 networks. The
different LTE frequencies and bands used in different countries mean
that only multi-band phones are able to use LTE in all countries where
it is supported.</p>
<p>LTE is commonly marketed as 4G LTE &amp; Advance 4G, but it does not meet
the technical criteria of a 4G wireless service, as specified in the
3GPP Release 8 and 9 document series for LTE Advanced. The requirements
were originally set forth by the ITU-R organization in the IMT Advanced
specification. However, due to marketing pressures and the significant
advancements that WiMAX, Evolved High Speed Packet Access and LTE bring
to the original 3G technologies, ITU later decided that LTE together
with the aforementioned technologies can be called 4G technologies. The
LTE Advanced standard formally satisfies the ITU-R requirements to be
considered IMT-Advanced.[4] To differentiate LTE Advanced and
WiMAX-Advanced from current 4G technologies, ITU has defined them as
&quot;True 4G&quot;</p>
<p>LTE-M</p>
<p>LTE-M (LTE-MTC [Machine Type Communication]), which includes eMTC
(enhanced Machine Type Communication), is a type of low power wide area
network (LPWAN) radio technology standard developed by 3GPP to enable a
wide range of cellular devices and services (specifically, for
machine-to-machine and Internet of Things applications). The
specification for eMTC (LTE Cat-M1) was frozen in 3GPP Release 13 (LTE
Advanced Pro), in June 2016. Other 3GPP IoT technologies include NB-IoT
and EC-GSM-IoT.</p>
<p>The advantage of LTE-M over NB-IoT is its comparatively higher data
rate, mobility, and voice over the network, but it requires more
bandwidth, is more costly, and cannot be put into guard band frequency
band for now. Compared to LTE Release 12 Cat-0 modem, an LTE-M model is
claimed to be 80% less expensive (in terms of the bill of materials),
support up to 18 dB better coverage, and a battery lifetime than can
last up to several years. In March 2019, the Global Mobile Suppliers
Association reported that over 100 operators had deployed/launched
either NB-IoT or LTE-M networks.</p>

<p>L2TP Tunnel Switch</p>
<p>L2TP tunnel switching, also known as L2TP multihop, simplifies the
deployment of an L2TP network across multiple domains. A router that
lies between a LAC and an LNS is configured as an L2TP tunnel switch
(LTS)---sometimes referred to simply as a tunnel switch or a tunnel
switching aggregator (TSA). The LTS is configured as both an LNS and a
LAC. When a remote LAC sends encapsulated PPP packets to the LNS
configured on the LTS, the LTS can forward or redirect the packets
through a different tunnel to a different LNS beyond the LTS. The
logical termination point of the original L2TP session is switched to a
different endpoint.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="latency"><a class="header" href="#latency">Latency</a></h1>
<p>Latency refers to a short period of delay (usually measured in
milliseconds) between when an audio signal enters and when it emerges
from a system. Potential contributors to latency in an audio system
include analog-to-digital conversion, buffering, digital signal
processing, transmission time, digital-to-analog conversion and the
speed of sound in the transmission medium.</p>
<p>Latency can be a critical performance metric in professional audio
including sound reinforcement systems, foldback systems (especially
those using in-ear monitors) live radio and television. Excessive audio
latency has the potential to degrade call quality in telecommunications
applications. Low latency audio in computers is important for
interactivity.</p>
<p>Telephone calls<br />
In all systems, latency can be said to consist of three elements: codec
delay, playout delay and network delay.</p>
<p>Latency in telephone calls is sometimes referred to as mouth-to-ear
delay; the telecommunications industry also uses the term quality of
experience (QoE). Voice quality is measured according to the ITU model;
measurable quality of a call degrades rapidly where the mouth-to-ear
delay latency exceeds 200 milliseconds. The mean opinion score (MOS) is
also comparable in a near-linear fashion with the ITU's quality scale -
defined in standards G.107 (page 800),G.108 and G.109 - with a quality
factor R ranging from 0 to 100. An MOS of 4 ('Good') would have an R
score of 80 or above; to achieve 100R requires an MOS exceeding 4.5.</p>
<p>Cellular calls<br />
The AMR narrowband codec, used currently in UMTS networks, is a low
bitrate, highly compressed, adaptive bitrate codec achieving rates from
4.75 to 12.2 kbit/s with 'toll quality' (MOS 4.0 or above) from 7.4
kbit/s. 2G networks use the AMR-12.2 codec, equivalent to GSM-EFR. As
mobile operators upgrade existing best-effort networks to support
concurrent multiple types of service over all-IP networks, services such
as Hierarchical Quality of Service (H-QoS) allow for per-user,
per-service QoS policies to prioritise time-sensitive protocols like
voice calls and other wireless backhaul traffic. Along with more
efficient voice codecs, this helps to maintain a sufficient MOS rating
whilst the volume of overall traffic on often oversubscribed mobile
networks increases with demand.</p>
<p>Another overlooked aspect of mobile latency is the inter-network
handoff; as a customer on Network A calls a Network B customer the call
must traverse two separate Radio Access Networks, two core networks and
an interlinking Gateway Mobile Switching Centre (GMSC) which performs
the physical interconnecting between the two providers.</p>
<p>IP calls<br />
On a stable connection with sufficient bandwidth and minimal latency,
VoIP systems typically have a minimum of 20 ms inherent latency and
target 150 ms as a maximum latency for general consumer use. With
end-to-end QoS managed and assured rate connections, latency can be
reduced to analogue PSTN/POTS levels. Latency is a larger consideration
in these systems when an echo is present therefore popular VoIP codecs
such as G.729 perform complex voice detection and noise suppression.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lawful-intercept"><a class="header" href="#lawful-intercept">Lawful intercept</a></h1>
<p>Lawful interception (LI) refers to the facilities in telecommunications
and telephone networks that allow law enforcement agencies with court
order or other legal authorization to selectively wiretap individual
subscribers. Most countries require licensed telecommunications
operators to provide their networks with Legal Interception gateways and
nodes for the interception of communications. The interfaces of these
gateways have been standardized by telecommunication standardization
organizations.</p>
<p>With the legacy public switched telephone network (PSTN), wireless, and
cable systems, lawful interception (LI) was generally performed by
accessing the mechanical or digital switches supporting the targets'
calls. The introduction of packet switched networks, softswitch
technology, and server-based applications the past two decades
fundamentally altered how LI is undertaken.</p>
<p>Lawful interception differs from the dragnet-type mass surveillance
sometimes done by intelligence agencies, where all data passing a
fiber-optic splice or other collection point is extracted for storage or
filtering. It is also separate from the data retention of metadata that
has become a legal requirement in some jurisdictions.</p>

<p>A leased line is a private bidirectional or symmetric telecommunications
circuit between two or more locations provided in exchange for a monthly
rent. Sometimes known as a private circuit or data line in the UK.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional PSTN lines they do not have telephone numbers, each
side of the line being permanently connected and dedicated to the other.
Leased lines can be used for telephone, Internet, or other data
services. Some are ringdown services, and some connect to a private
branch exchange or router.</p>
<p>Typically, leased lines are used by businesses to connect geographically
distant offices. Unlike dial-up connections, a leased line is always
active. The fee for the connection is a fixed monthly rate. The primary
factors affecting the monthly fee are distance between end points and
the speed of the circuit. Because the connection does not carry anybody
else's communications, the carrier can assure a given level of quality.</p>
<p>An Internet leased line is a premium Internet connectivity product,
normally delivered over fiber, which provides uncontended, symmetrical
speeds with full duplex. It is also known as an ethernet leased line,
dedicated line, data circuit or private line.</p>
<p>For example, a T1 can be leased and provides a maximum transmission
speed of 1.544 Mbit/s. The user can channelize the T1 to separate the 24
DS0 circuits for voice communication, partial the T1 for data and voice
communications, or multiplex the channels into a single data circuit.
Leased lines, as opposed to DSL, are being used by companies and
individuals for Internet access because they afford faster data transfer
rates and are cost-effective for heavy users of the Internet.</p>

<p>Linux is a family of free and open-source software operating systems
built around the Linux kernel. Typically, Linux is packaged in a form
known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and
server use. The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux
kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991,
by Linus Torvalds. Many Linux distributions use the word &quot;Linux&quot; in
their name. The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to
refer to the operating system family, as well as specific distributions,
to emphasize that most Linux distributions are not just the Linux
kernel, and that they have in common not only the kernel, but also
numerous utilities and libraries, a large proportion of which are from
the GNU project.<br />

<p>Lisp (historically, LISP) is a family of computer programming languages
with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix
notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest
high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is
older, by one year. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many
dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best known
general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme.</p>
<p>Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical
notation for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo
Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became the favored programming
language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As one of the
earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer
science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management,
dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the
self-hosting compiler, and the read--eval--print loop.</p>
<p>The name LISP derives from &quot;LISt Processor&quot;. Linked lists are one of
Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists.
Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure,
giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to
create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.</p>
<p>The interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly
recognizable syntax. All program code is written as s-expressions, or
parenthesized lists. A function call or syntactic form is written as a
list with the function or operator's name first, and the arguments
following; for instance, a function f that takes three arguments would
be called as (f arg1 arg2 arg3).</p>

<p>Machine to machine</p>
<p>Machine to machine (commonly abbreviated as M2M) refers to direct
communication between devices using any communications channel,
including wired and wireless. Machine to machine communication can
include industrial instrumentation, enabling a sensor or meter to
communicate the data it records (such as temperature, inventory level,
etc.) to application software that can use it (for example, adjusting an
industrial process based on temperature or placing orders to replenish
inventory). Such communication was originally accomplished by having a
remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for
analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal
computer.</p>
<p>More recent machine to machine communication has changed into a system
of networks that transmits data to personal appliances. The expansion of
IP networks around the world has made machine to machine communication
quicker and easier while using less power. These networks also allow new
business opportunities for consumers and suppliers.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mac-address"><a class="header" href="#mac-address">MAC Address</a></h1>
<p>Media Access Control Address</p>
<p>A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is a unique
identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for
communications at the data link layer of a network segment. MAC
addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network
technologies, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi. In this context, MAC
addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer.</p>
<p>A MAC may be referred to as the burned-in address (BIA). It may also be
known as an Ethernet hardware address (EHA), hardware address or
physical address (not to be confused with a memory physical address).</p>
<p>A network node may have multiple NICs and each NIC must have a unique
MAC address. Sophisticated network equipment such as a multilayer switch
or router may require one or more permanently assigned MAC addresses.</p>
<p>MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a NIC and
are stored in its hardware, such as the card's read-only memory or some
other firmware mechanism. A MAC address may include the manufacturer's
organizationally unique identifier (OUI). MAC addresses are formed
according to the rules of one of three numbering name spaces managed by
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE): MAC-48,
EUI-48, and EUI-64.[1][2] EUI is an abbreviation for Extended Unique
Identifier.</p>

<p>In computer networking, a media access control attack or MAC flooding is
a technique employed to compromise the security of network switches. The
attack works by forcing legitimate MAC table contents out of the switch
and forcing a unicast flooding behavior potentially sending sensitive
information to portions of the network where it is not normally intended
to go.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mac-spoofing"><a class="header" href="#mac-spoofing">MAC Spoofing</a></h1>
<p>MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access
Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. The
MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC)
cannot be changed. However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be
changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an operating
system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing.
The process of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing.
Essentially, MAC spoofing entails changing a computer's identity, for
any reason, and it is relatively easy.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mac"><a class="header" href="#mac">MAC</a></h1>
<p>Media Access Control</p>
<p>In IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards, the medium access control (MAC) sublayer
(also known as the media access control sublayer) and the logical link
control (LLC) sublayer together make up the data link layer. Within that
data link layer, the LLC provides flow control and multiplexing for the
logical link (i.e. EtherType, 802.1Q VLAN tag etc), while the MAC
provides flow control and multiplexing for the transmission medium.</p>
<p>These two sublayers together correspond to layer 2 of the OSI model. For
compatibility reasons, LLC is optional for implementations of IEEE 802.3
(the frames are then &quot;raw&quot;), but compulsory for implementations of all
other IEEE 802 standards. Within the hierarchy of the OSI model and IEEE
802 standards, the MAC block provides a control abstraction of the
physical layer such that the complexities of physical link control are
invisible to the LLC and upper layers of the network stack. Thus any LLC
block (and higher layers) may be used with any MAC. In turn, the medium
access control block is formally connected to the PHY via a
media-independent interface. Although the MAC block is today typically
integrated with the PHY within the same device package, historically any
MAC could be used with any PHY, independent of the transmission medium.</p>
<p>When sending data to another device on the network, the MAC block
encapsulates higher-level frames into frames appropriate for the
transmission medium (i.e. the MAC adds a syncword preamble and also
padding if necessary), adds a frame check sequence to identify
transmission errors, and then forwards the data to the physical layer as
soon as the appropriate channel access method permits it. Controlling
when data is sent and when to wait is necessary to avoid congestion and
collisions, especially for topologies with a collision domain (bus,
ring, mesh, point-to-multipoint topologies). Additionally, the MAC is
also responsible for compensating for congestion and collisions by
initiating retransmission if a jam signal is detected, and/or
negotiating a slower transmission rate if necessary. When receiving data
from the physical layer, the MAC block ensures data integrity by
verifying the sender's frame check sequences, and strips off the
sender's preamble and padding before passing the data up to the higher
layers.</p>

<p>Mobile Adhoc NETwork</p>
<p>A mobile ad hoc network (MANET), also known as wireless ad hoc network
or ad hoc wireless network, is a continuously self-configuring,
infrastructure-less network of mobile devices connected wirelessly.</p>
<p>Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction,
and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. Each
must forward traffic unrelated to its own use, and therefore be a
router. The primary challenge in building a MANET is equipping each
device to continuously maintain the information required to properly
route traffic.[4] Such networks may operate by themselves or may be
connected to the larger Internet. They may contain one or multiple and
different transceivers between nodes. This results in a highly dynamic,
autonomous topology.</p>
<p>MANETs are a kind of wireless ad hoc network (WANET) that usually has a
routable networking environment on top of a Link Layer ad hoc network.
MANETs consist of a peer-to-peer, self-forming, self-healing network.
MANETs circa 2000--2015 typically communicate at radio frequencies (30
MHz -- 5 GHz).<br />

<p>Message Digest 5</p>
<p>The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit
hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a
cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive
vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data
integrity, but only against unintentional corruption.</p>
<p>Like most hash functions, MD5 is neither encryption nor encoding. It can
be cracked by brute-force attack and suffers from extensive
vulnerabilities as detailed in the security section below.</p>
<p>MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash
function MD4.[3] The source code in RFC 1321 contains a &quot;by
attribution&quot; RSA license. The abbreviation &quot;MD&quot; stands for &quot;Message
Digest.&quot;</p>
<p>The security of MD5 has been severely compromised, with its weaknesses
having been exploited in the field, most infamously by the Flame malware
in 2012. The CMU Software Engineering Institute considers MD5
essentially &quot;cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use&quot;</p>

<p>Mixed-excitation linear prediction</p>
<p>Mixed-excitation linear prediction (MELP) is a United States Department
of Defense speech coding standard used mainly in military applications
and satellite communications, secure voice, and secure radio devices.
Its standardization and later development was led and supported by NSA,
and NATO.<br />
Compression level<br />
MELPe is intended for the compression of speech. Given an audio input
sampled at 8 kHz, the MELPe codec yields the following compression
ratios over a 64 kbit/s μ-Law G.711 datastream, discounting the effects
of protocol overhead:</p>
<p><img src="Glossary/m/./images/14909510.png" alt="" /><br />
Generally, speech coding involves a trade-off of different aspects
including bit-rate, speech quality, delay (frame size and lookahead),
computational complexity, robustness to different speakers and
languages, robustness to different background noises, channel error
robustness, and also codec state recovery in the face of packet loss.
Since the MELPe's lower rates (600 and 1200 bit/s) are supersets of the
2400 bit/s rate, the algorithm complexity (e.g. in MIPS) is about the
same for all rates. The lower rates use increased frames and lookahead,
as well as codebook size, therefore they require more memory.  </p>

<p>Media Gateway Control Protocol</p>
<p>The Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) is a signaling and call
control communications protocol used in voice over IP (VoIP)
telecommunication systems. It implements the media gateway control
protocol architecture for controlling media gateways on Internet
Protocol (IP) networks connected to the public switched telephone
network (PSTN). The protocol is a successor to the Simple Gateway
Control Protocol (SGCP), which was developed by Bellcore and Cisco, and
the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC).</p>
<p>The methodology of MGCP reflects the structure of the PSTN with the
power of the network residing in a call control center softswitch which
is analogous to the central office in the telephone network. The
endpoints are low-intelligence devices, mostly executing control
commands and providing result indications in response. The protocol
represents a decomposition of other VoIP models, such as H.323, in which
the H.323 Gatekeeper, have higher levels of signaling intelligence.</p>
<p>MGCP is a text-based protocol consisting of commands and responses. It
uses the Session Description Protocol (SDP) for specifying and
negotiating the media streams to be transmitted in a call session and
the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for framing the media streams.<br />

<p>MP3 (formally MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III) is an
audio coding format for digital audio. Originally defined as the third
audio format of the MPEG-1 standard, it was retained and further
extended---defining additional bit rates and support for more audio
channels---as the third audio format of the subsequent MPEG-2 standard.
A third version, known as MPEG 2.5---extended to better support lower
bit rates---is commonly implemented, but is not a recognized standard.</p>
<p>MP3 (or mp3) as a file format commonly designates files containing an
elementary stream of MPEG-1 audio and video encoded data, without other
complexities of the MP3 standard.</p>
<p>In the aspects of MP3 pertaining to audio compression---the aspect of
the standard most apparent to end users (and for which is it best
known)---MP3 uses lossy data compression to encode data using inexact
approximations and the partial discarding of data. This allows a large
reduction in file size when compared to uncompressed audio. The
combination of small size and acceptable fidelity led to a boom in the
distribution of music over the Internet in the mid to late 1990s, as an
enabling technology when bandwidth and storage were still at a premium.
The MP3 format soon became associated with controversies surrounding
copyright infringement, music piracy, the file ripping/sharing
services <a href="http://mp3.com/">MP3.com</a> and Napster, among others. With the
advent of portable media players, a product category also including
smartphones, MP3 support remains near-universal.</p>
<p>MP3 compression works by reducing (or approximating) the accuracy of
certain components of sound that are considered to be beyond the hearing
capabilities of most humans. This method is commonly referred to as
perceptual coding, or psychoacoustic modeling. The remaining audio
information is then recorded in a space-efficient manner. Compared to
CD-quality digital audio, MP3 compression can commonly achieve a 75 to
95% reduction in size. For example, an MP3 encoded at a constant bitrate
of 128 kbit/s would result in a file approximately 9% the size of the
original CD audio.</p>
<p>Also designed as a streamable format, segments of a transmission can be
lost without affecting the ability to decode later segments.</p>

<p>Message Queuing Telemetry Transport</p>
<p>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC
PRF 20922) publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on top
of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote
locations where a &quot;small code footprint&quot; is required or the network
bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a
message broker.</p>
<p>Andy Stanford-Clark of IBM and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link authored the
first version of the protocol in 1999.</p>
<p>The specification does not specify the meaning of &quot;small code footprint&quot;
or the meaning of &quot;limited network bandwidth&quot;. Thus, the protocol's
availability for use depends on the context. In 2013, IBM submitted MQTT
v3.1 to the OASIS specification body with a charter that ensured only
minor changes to the specification could be accepted. MQTT-SN is a
variation of the main protocol aimed at embedded devices on non-TCP/IP
networks, such as ZigBee.</p>
<p>Historically, the &quot;MQ&quot; in &quot;MQTT&quot; came from IBM's MQ Series message
queuing product line.[6] However, queuing itself is not required to be

<p>Mobile switching center</p>
<p>The mobile switching center (MSC) is the primary service delivery node
for GSM/CDMA, responsible for routing voice calls and SMS as well as
other services (such as conference calls, FAX and circuit switched
data).</p>
<p>The MSC sets up and releases the end-to-end connection, handles mobility
and hand-over requirements during the call and takes care of charging
and real time prepaid account monitoring.</p>
<p>In the GSM mobile phone system, in contrast with earlier analogue
services, fax and data information is sent digitally encoded directly to
the MSC. Only at the MSC is this re-coded into an &quot;analogue&quot; signal
(although actually this will almost certainly mean sound is encoded
digitally as a pulse-code modulation (PCM) signal in a 64-kbit/s
timeslot, known as a DS0 in America).</p>
<p>There are various different names for MSCs in different contexts which
reflects their complex role in the network, all of these terms though
could refer to the same MSC, but doing different things at different
times.</p>
<p>The gateway MSC (G-MSC) is the MSC that determines which &quot;visited MSC&quot;
(V-MSC) the subscriber who is being called is currently located at. It
also interfaces with the PSTN. All mobile to mobile calls and PSTN to
mobile calls are routed through a G-MSC. The term is only valid in the
context of one call, since any MSC may provide both the gateway function
and the visited MSC function. However, some manufacturers design
dedicated high capacity MSCs which do not have any base station
subsystems (BSS) connected to them. These MSCs will then be the gateway
MSC for many of the calls they handle.</p>
<p>The visited MSC (V-MSC) is the MSC where a customer is currently
located. The visitor location register (VLR) associated with this MSC
will have the subscriber's data in it.</p>
<p>The anchor MSC is the MSC from which a handover has been initiated. The
target MSC is the MSC toward which a handover should take place. A
mobile switching center server is a part of the redesigned MSC concept
starting from 3GPP Release 4.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="machine-code"><a class="header" href="#machine-code">Machine code</a></h1>
<p>Machine code is a computer program written in machine language
instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's central
processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very
specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of
data in a CPU register or memory.</p>
<p>Machine code is a strictly numerical language which is intended to run
as fast as possible, and may be regarded as the lowest-level
representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a
primitive and hardware-dependent programming language. While it is
possible to write programs directly in machine code, it is tedious and
error prone to manage individual bits and calculate numerical addresses
and constants manually. For this reason, programs are very rarely
written directly in machine code in modern contexts, but may be done for
low level debugging, program patching, and assembly language
disassembly.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of practical programs today are written in
higher-level languages or assembly language. The source code is then
translated to executable machine code by utilities such as compilers,
assemblers, and linkers, with the important exception of interpreted
programs, which are not translated into machine code. However, the
interpreter itself, which may be seen as an executor or processor,
performing the instructions of the source code, typically consists of
directly executable machine code (generated from assembly or high-level
language source code).</p>
<p>Machine code is by definition the lowest level of programming detail
visible to the programmer, but internally many processors use microcode
or optimise and transform machine code instructions into sequences of
micro-ops, this is not generally considered to be a machine code per se</p>

<p>Telecommunications mediation is a process that converts call data to
pre-defined layouts that can be imported by a specific billing system or
other OSS applications<br />
A billing mediation platform is a system used to convert data of certain
datatypes to other datatypes, usually for billing purposes. Billing
Mediation Platforms are used mostly by telephone companies, who
typically need to process UDRs (Usage Detail Records). In call scenarios
UDRs are most often known as CDRs (Call Detail Records), and among
broadband carriers they are often referred to as IPDR<br />
Billing mediation platforms get their name from their behavior: they
&quot;mediate&quot; data between systems. In a typical telephone company scenario,
the systems providing data to the mediation platform are network
elements, such as telephone switches, and the systems receiving data
from the mediation platform perform accounting, auditing, archiving, or
bill-generation functions. The mediation system collects, collates and
prepares data for consumption by the downstream systems, which often
accept data only in a limited set of formats.<br />
Functionality<br />
Typically a mediation platform is used for the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Collection and validation of CDRs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtering out of non billing-relevant CDRs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correlation of different input sources CDRs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregation of partial CDRs related to the same call</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Format change and CDRs normalization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business transformation of data</p>
<p>In a telecom billing scenario, mediation is the first step after
receiving a CDR. The mediated CDR is forwarded to a rating engine,
which calculates the charge associated with the CDRs. In today's
world Rating Engines are more becoming necessary for the telecom
billing system to meet the growing variant customer needs for
different services.[citation needed]</p>
<p>Despite the name, not all of the data transferred via billing
mediation platforms is actually used for billing purposes. For
instance, the mediation software might generate traffic volume
statistics based on the number and origin of the records passing
through it. Those statistics could then be used for capacity
planning, as part of a network monitoring procedure, or for any
other business intelligence applications.</p>
<p>At core Mediation involves data transfer between various systems
with or without modification of data starting from Network elements
to OSS/BSS systems.</p>
<p>Sophisticated Billing Mediation software serves end to end
functionality for telecom operators. Mediation software performs
various operation from data collection to downstream distribution to
modules like retail billing, interconnect settlement, business
intelligence, fraud detection and revenue assurance.</p>

<p>Provisioning services for the subscription.</p>
<p>Complementary to Billing Mediation functions, comprehensive
mediation platforms also provide functionality dedicated to Service
Provisioning (the two areas frequently intermix as services
configured and used by the end customer result in usage data records
generation in the network).</p>
<p>Mediating between the systems is not the only job that Mediation
Platform can do. Actually this can be used as a provisioning agent.
The basic provisioning commands can be configured within the
mediation system and whenever we get a request for the system which
does the provisioning, the request can be converted into a file, in
which mediation can append the service provisioning commands and
send it to HLR for activating any request. This of course, load
dependent but can come very handy when there is a crisis in the
other system.</p>

<p>Modern mobile phone networks use cells because radio frequencies are a
limited, shared resource. Cell-sites and handsets change frequency under
computer control and use low power transmitters so that the usually
limited number of radio frequencies can be simultaneously used by many
callers with less interference.</p>
<p>A cellular network is used by the mobile phone operator to achieve both
coverage and capacity for their subscribers. Large geographic areas are
split into smaller cells to avoid line-of-sight signal loss and to
support a large number of active phones in that area. All of the cell
sites are connected to telephone exchanges (or switches), which in turn
connect to the public telephone network.</p>
<p>In cities, each cell site may have a range of up to approximately 1⁄2
mile (0.80 km), while in rural areas, the range could be as much as 5
miles (8.0 km). It is possible that in clear open areas, a user may
receive signals from a cell site 25 miles (40 km) away.</p>
<p>Since almost all mobile phones use cellular technology, including GSM,
CDMA, and AMPS (analog), the term &quot;cell phone&quot; is in some regions,
notably the US, used interchangeably with &quot;mobile phone&quot;. However,
satellite phones are mobile phones that do not communicate directly with
a ground-based cellular tower, but may do so indirectly by way of a
satellite.</p>
<p>There are a number of different digital cellular technologies,
including: Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet
Radio Service (GPRS), cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Evolution-Data Optimized
(EV-DO), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS), Digital Enhanced Cordless
Telecommunications (DECT), Digital AMPS (IS-136/TDMA), and Integrated
Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN). The transition from existing analog to
the digital standard followed a very different path in Europe and the
US.[11] As a consequence, multiple digital standards surfaced in the
US, while Europe and many countries converged towards the GSM standard.</p>

<p>In computer networking, multicast is group communication where data

simultaneously. Multicast can be one-to-many or many-to-many
distribution. Multicast should not be confused with physical layer
point-to-multipoint communication.</p>
<p>Group communication may either be application layer multicast or network
assisted multicast, where the latter makes it possible for the source to
efficiently send to the group in a single transmission. Copies are
automatically created in other network elements, such as routers,
switches and cellular network base stations, but only to network
segments that currently contain members of the group. Network assisted
multicast may be implemented at the data link layer using one-to-many
addressing and switching such as Ethernet multicast addressing,
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), point-to-multipoint virtual circuits
<a href="Glossary/m/3">P2MP</a> or Infiniband multicast. Network assisted multicast may also
be implemented at the Internet layer using IP multicast. In IP multicast
the implementation of the multicast concept occurs at the IP routing
level, where routers create optimal distribution paths for datagrams
sent to a multicast destination address.</p>
<p>Multicast is often employed in Internet Protocol (IP) applications of
streaming media, such as IPTV and multipoint videoconferencing.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="multiplex"><a class="header" href="#multiplex">Multiplex</a></h1>
<p>In telecommunications and computer networks, multiplexing (sometimes
contracted to muxing) is a method by which multiple analog or digital
signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium. The aim is to
share a scarce resource. For example, in telecommunications, several
telephone calls may be carried using one wire. Multiplexing originated
in telegraphy in the 1870s, and is now widely applied in communications.
In telephony, George Owen Squier is credited with the development of
telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910.</p>
<p>The multiplexed signal is transmitted over a communication channel such
as a cable. The multiplexing divides the capacity of the communication
channel into several logical channels, one for each message signal or
data stream to be transferred. A reverse process, known as
demultiplexing, extracts the original channels on the receiver end.</p>
<p>A device that performs the multiplexing is called a multiplexer (MUX),
and a device that performs the reverse process is called a demultiplexer
(DEMUX or DMX).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mutex"><a class="header" href="#mutex">Mutex</a></h1>
<p>In computer science, a lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a
synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource
in an environment where there are many threads of execution. A lock is
designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mutual-exclusion"><a class="header" href="#mutual-exclusion">Mutual Exclusion</a></h1>
<p>In computer science, mutual exclusion is a property of concurrency
control, which is instituted for the purpose of preventing race
conditions; it is the requirement that one thread of execution never
enter its critical section at the same time that another concurrent
thread of execution enters its own critical section.</p>
<p>The requirement of mutual exclusion was first identified and solved by
Edsger W. Dijkstra in his seminal 1965 paper titled Solution of a
problem in concurrent programming control,[1][2] which is credited
as the first topic in the study of concurrent algorithms.</p>
<p>A simple example of why mutual exclusion is important in practice can be
visualized using a singly linked list of four items, where the second
and third are to be removed. The removal of a node that sits between 2
other nodes is performed by changing the next pointer of the previous
node to point to the next node (in other words, if node i is being
removed, then the next pointer of node i - 1 is changed to point to node
i + 1, thereby removing from the linked list any reference to node i).
When such a linked list is being shared between multiple threads of
execution, two threads of execution may attempt to remove two different
nodes simultaneously, one thread of execution changing the next pointer
of node i - 1 to point to node i + 1, while another thread of execution
changes the next pointer of node i to point to node i + 2. Although both
removal operations complete successfully, the desired state of the
linked list is not achieved: node i + 1 remains in the list, because the
next pointer of node i - 1 points to node i + 1.</p>
<p>This problem (called a race condition) can be avoided by using the
requirement of mutual exclusion to ensure that simultaneous updates to
the same part of the list cannot occur.</p>
<p>The term mutual exclusion is also used in reference to the simultaneous
writing of a memory address by one thread while the aforementioned
memory address is being manipulated or read by another thread or other
threads.</p>

<p>Network Address Port Translation</p>
<p>All IP packets have a source IP address and a destination IP address.
Typically packets passing from the private network to the public network
will have their source address modified, while packets passing from the
public network back to the private network will have their destination
address modified. To avoid ambiguity in how replies are translated,
further modifications to the packets are required. The vast bulk of
Internet traffic uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User
Datagram Protocol (UDP). For these protocols the port numbers are
changed so that the combination of IP address and port information on
the returned packet can be unambiguously mapped to the corresponding
private network destination. RFC 2663 uses the term network address and
port translation (NAPT) for this type of NAT. Other names include port
address translation (PAT), IP masquerading, NAT overload and many-to-one
NAT. This is the most common type of NAT and has become synonymous with
the term &quot;NAT&quot; in common usage.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="nat"><a class="header" href="#nat">NAT</a></h1>
<p>Network Address Translation</p>
<p>Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP
address space into another by modifying network address information in
the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic
routing device. The technique was originally used as a shortcut to avoid
the need to readdress every host when a network was moved. It has become
a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the
face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a
NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.</p>
<p>IP masquerading is a technique that hides an entire IP address space,
usually consisting of private IP addresses, behind a single IP address
in another, usually public address space. The address that has to be
hidden is changed into a single (public) IP address as &quot;new&quot; source
address of the outgoing IP packet so it appears as originating not from
the hidden host but from the routing device itself. Because of the
popularity of this technique to conserve IPv4 address space, the term
NAT has become virtually synonymous with IP masquerading.</p>
<p>As network address translation modifies the IP address information in
packets, it has serious consequences on the quality of Internet
connectivity and requires careful attention to the details of its
implementation. NAT implementations vary widely in their specific
behavior in various addressing cases and their effect on network
traffic. The specifics of NAT behavior are not commonly documented by
vendors of equipment containing NAT implementations.<br />

(LPWAN) radio technology standard developed by 3GPP for cellular devices
and services. The specification was frozen in 3GPP Release 13 (LTE
Advanced Pro), in June 2016. Other 3GPP IoT technologies include eMTC
(enhanced Machine-Type Communication) and EC-GSM-IoT.</p>
<p>NB-IoT focuses specifically on indoor coverage, low cost, long battery
life, and high connection density. NB-IoT uses a subset of the LTE
standard, but limits the bandwidth to a single narrow-band of 200kHz. It
uses OFDM modulation for downlink communication and SC-FDMA for uplink
communications. IoT applications which require more frequent
communications will be better served by NB-IoT, which has no duty cycle
limitations operating on the licensed spectrum.</p>
<p>The NB-IoT technology operates using resource blocks on existing LTE
networks or in the LTE carrier's guard bands. It can also operate using
unused 200 khz bands that were previously used by GSM.</p>

<p>Network File System</p>
<p>Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol
originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984, allowing a user on a
client computer to access files over a computer network much like local
storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open
Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system. The NFS is an
open standard defined in Request for Comments (RFC), allowing anyone to
implement the protocol.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ngn"><a class="header" href="#ngn">NGN</a></h1>
<p>Next Generation Networks</p>
<p>The next-generation network (NGN) is a body of key architectural changes
in telecommunication core and access networks. The general idea behind
the NGN is that one network transports all information and services
(voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating
these into IP packets, similar to those used on the Internet. NGNs are
commonly built around the Internet Protocol, and therefore the term all
IP is also sometimes used to describe the transformation of formerly
telephone-centric networks toward NGN.</p>
<p>According to ITU-T, the definition is:</p>
<p>A next-generation network (NGN) is a packet-based network which can
provide services including Telecommunication Services and is able to
make use of multiple broadband, quality of Service-enabled transport
technologies and in which service-related functions are independent from
underlying transport-related technologies. It offers unrestricted access
by users to different service providers. It supports generalized
mobility which will allow consistent and ubiquitous provision of
services to users.<br />
From a practical perspective, NGN involves three main architectural
changes that need to be looked at separately:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the core network, NGN implies a consolidation of several
(dedicated or overlay) transport networks each historically built
for a different service into one core transport network (often based
on IP and Ethernet). It implies amongst others the migration of
voice from a circuit-switched architecture (PSTN) to VoIP, and also
migration of legacy services such as X.25, frame relay (either
commercial migration of the customer to a new service like IP VPN,
or technical emigration by emulation of the &quot;legacy service&quot; on the
NGN).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the wired access network, NGN implies the migration from the dual
system of legacy voice next to xDSL setup in local exchanges to a
converged setup in which the DSLAMs integrate voice ports or VoIP,
making it possible to remove the voice switching infrastructure from
the exchange.[2]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the cable access network, NGN convergence implies migration of
constant bit rate voice to CableLabs PacketCable standards that
provide VoIP and SIP services. Both services ride over DOCSIS as the
cable data layer standard.</p>
<p>In an NGN, there is a more defined separation between the transport
(connectivity) portion of the network and the services that run on
top of that transport. This means that whenever a provider wants to
enable a new service, they can do so by defining it directly at the
service layer without considering the transport layer --
i.e. services are independent of transport details. Increasingly
applications, including voice, tend to be independent of the access
network (de-layering of network and applications) and will reside
more on end-user devices (phone, PC, set-top box).</p>
<p>Underlying technology components<br />
Next-generation networks are based on Internet technologies
including Internet Protocol (IP) and multiprotocol label switching
(MPLS). At the application level, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
seems to be taking over from ITU-T H.323.</p>
<p>Initially H.323 was the most popular protocol, though its popularity
decreased in the &quot;local loop&quot; due to its original poor traversal of
network address translation (NAT) and firewalls. For this reason as
domestic VoIP services have been developed, SIP has been more widely
adopted. However, in voice networks where everything is under the
control of the network operator or telco, many of the largest
carriers use H.323 as the protocol of choice in their core
backbones.[citation needed] With the most recent changes
introduced for H.323, it is now possible for H.323 devices to easily
and consistently traverse NAT and firewall devices, opening up the
possibility that H.323 may again be looked upon more favorably in
cases where such devices encumbered its use previously. Nonetheless,
most of the telcos are extensively researching and supporting IP
Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which gives SIP a major chance of being
the most widely adopted protocol.</p>
<p>For voice applications one of the most important devices in NGN is a
Softswitch -- a programmable device that controls Voice over IP
(VoIP) calls. It enables correct integration of different protocols
within NGN. The most important function of the Softswitch is
creating the interface to the existing telephone network, PSTN,
through Signalling Gateways and Media Gateways. However, the
Softswitch as a term may be defined differently by the different
equipment manufacturers and have somewhat different functions.</p>
<p>One may quite often find the term Gatekeeper in NGN literature. This
was originally a VoIP device, which converted (using gateways) voice
and data from their analog or digital switched-circuit form (PSTN,
SS7) to the packet-based one (IP). It controlled one or more
gateways. As soon as this kind of device started using the Media
Gateway Control Protocol, the name was changed to Media Gateway
Controller (MGC).</p>
<p>A Call Agent is a general name for devices/systems controlling
calls.</p>
<p>The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a standardised NGN architecture
for an Internet media-services capability defined by the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).</p>

<p>Weighted Fair Queueing</p>
<p>See PWFQ<br />
Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) is a network scheduler scheduling
algorithm. WFQ is both a packet-based implementation of the generalized
processor sharing (GPS) policy, and a natural extension of fair queuing
(FQ). Whereas FQ shares the link's capacity in equal subparts, WFQ
allows schedulers to specify, for each flow, which fraction of the
capacity will be given.</p>
<p>Weighted fair queuing is also known as packet-by-packet GPS (PGPS or
P-GPS) since it approximates generalized processor sharing &quot;to within
one packet transmission time, regardless of the arrival patterns.&quot;<br />

<p>Network-to-network interface</p>
<p>See UNI<br />
In telecommunications, a network-to-network interface (NNI) is an
interface that specifies signalling and management functions between two
networks. An NNI circuit can be used for interconnection of signalling
(e.g., SS7), Internet Protocol (IP) (e.g., MPLS) or ATM networks.</p>
<p>In networks based on MPLS or GMPLS, NNI is used for the interconnection
of core Provider Routers (class 4 or higher). In the case of GMPLS, the
type of interconnection can vary across Back-to-Back, EBGP or mixed NNI
connection scenarios, depending on the type of VRF exchange used for
interconnection. In case of Back-to-Back, VRF is necessary to create
VLANs and subsequently sub-interfaces (VLAN headers and DLCI headers for
Ethernet and frame relay network packets) on each interface used for the
NNI circuit. In the case of eBGP NNI interconnection, P routers are
taught how to dynamically exchange VRF records without VLAN creation.
NNI also can be used for interconnection of two VoIP nodes. In cases of
mixed or full-mesh scenarios, other NNI types are possible.<br />

<p>Network News Transfer Protocol</p>
<p>The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is an application protocol
used for transporting Usenet news articles (netnews) between news
servers and for reading and posting articles by end user client
applications. Brian Kantor of the University of California, San Diego
and Phil Lapsley of the University of California, Berkeley wrote RFC
977, the specification for the Network News Transfer Protocol, in March
1986. Other contributors included Stan O. Barber from the Baylor College
of Medicine and Erik Fair of Apple Computer.</p>
<p>Usenet was originally designed based on the UUCP network, with most
article transfers taking place over direct point-to-point telephone
links between news servers, which were powerful time-sharing systems.
Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles
directly from the local disk.</p>
<p>As local area networks and Internet participation proliferated, it
became desirable to allow newsreaders to be run on personal computers
connected to local networks. The resulting protocol was NNTP, which
resembled the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) but was tailored for
exchanging newsgroup articles.</p>

<p>Network switching subsystem</p>
<p>Network switching subsystem (NSS) (or GSM core network) is the component
of a GSM system that carries out call out and mobility management
functions for mobile phones roaming on the network of base stations. It
is owned and deployed by mobile phone operators and allows mobile
devices to communicate with each other and telephones in the wider
public switched telephone network4g LET(PSTN). The architecture contains
specific features and functions which are needed because the phones are
not fixed in one location.</p>
<p>The NSS originally consisted of the circuit-switched core network, used
for traditional GSM services such as voice calls, SMS, and circuit
switched data calls. It was extended with an overlay architecture to
provide packet-switched data services known as the GPRS core network.
This allows mobile phones to have access to services such as WAP, MMS
and the Internet.<br />

<p>Network Time Protocol</p>
<p>Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock
synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched,
variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is
one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by
David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.</p>
<p>NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a
few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).[1]:3 It uses the
intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo's algorithm, to
select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of
variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens
of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than
one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions.
Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or
more</p>

for example, to allow any caller to dial a local call to the called

<p>Network as a Service</p>
<p>Network as a service (NaaS) describes services for network transport
connectivity. NaaS involves the optimization of resource allocations by
considering network and computing resources as a unified whole</p>
<p>The term &quot;Network as a service&quot; (NaaS) is often used along with other
marketing terms like cloud computing, along with acronyms such as
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS),
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Communication-as-a-Service (CaaS).</p>
<p>NaaS sometimes includes the provision of a virtual network service by
the owners of the network infrastructure to a third party. Often this
includes network virtualization using a protocol such as OpenFlow.</p>
<p>Some service models are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Private Network (VPN): Extends a private network and the
resources contained in the network across networks like the public
Internet. It enables a host computer to send and receive data across
shared or public networks as if it were a private network with the
functionality and policies of the private network.</li>
<li>Bandwidth on demand (BoD): Technique by which network capacity is
assigned based on requirements between different nodes or users.
Under this model link rates can be dynamically adapted to the
traffic demands of the nodes connected to the link.</li>
<li>Mobile network virtualization: Model in which a telecommunications
manufacturer or independent network operator builds and operates a
network (wireless, or transport connectivity) and sells its
communication access capabilities to third parties (commonly mobile
phone operators) charging by capacity utilization. A mobile virtual
network operator (MVNO), is a mobile communications services
provider that does not own the radio spectrum or wireless network
infrastructure over which it provides services. Commonly a MVNO
offers its communication services using the network infrastructure
of an established mobile network operator.</li>

<p>Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.)
of a communication network.</p>
<p>Network topology is the topological[3] structure of a network and may
be depicted physically or logically. It is an application of graph
theory[4] wherein communicating devices are modeled as nodes and the
connections between the devices are modeled as links or lines between
the nodes. Physical topology is the placement of the various components
of a network (e.g., device location and cable installation), while
logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network. Distances
between nodes, physical interconnections, transmission rates, or signal
types may differ between two different networks, yet their topologies
may be identical. A network's physical topology is a particular concern
of the physical layer of the OSI model. Network topology can be used to
define or describe the arrangement of various types of telecommunication
networks, including command and control radio networks,[4] industrial
fieldbusses, and computer networks.</p>
<p>Examples of network typologies are found in local area networks (LAN), a
common computer network installation. Any given node in the LAN has one
or more physical links to other devices in the network; graphically
mapping these links results in a geometric shape that can be used to
describe the physical topology of the network. A wide variety of
physical topologies have been used in LANs, including ring, bus, mesh
and star. Conversely, mapping the data flow between the components
determines the logical topology of the network. In comparison,
Controller Area Networks, common in vehicles, are primarily distributed
control system networks of one or more controllers interconnected with
sensors and actuators over, invariably, a physical bus topology.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="nosql"><a class="header" href="#nosql">NoSQL</a></h1>
<p>A NoSQL (originally referring to &quot;non SQL&quot; or &quot;non relational&quot;) database
provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled
in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the
&quot;NoSQL&quot; moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first
century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases
are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL
systems are also sometimes called &quot;Not only SQL&quot; to emphasize that they
may support SQL-like query languages.</p>
<p>Motivations for this approach include: simplicity of design, simpler
&quot;horizontal&quot; scaling to clusters of machines (which is a
problem for relational databases), and finer control over availability.
The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, wide
column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in
relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The
particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem
it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are
also viewed as &quot;more flexible&quot; than relational database tables.</p>
<p>Many NoSQL stores compromise consistency (in the sense of the CAP
theorem) in favor of availability, partition tolerance, and speed.
Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL stores include the use of
low-level query languages (instead of SQL, for instance the lack of
ability to perform ad-hoc joins across tables), lack of standardized
interfaces, and huge previous investments in existing relational
databases.[ Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions, although a
few databases, such as MarkLogic, Aerospike, FairCom c-treeACE, Google
Spanner (though technically a NewSQL database), Symas LMDB, and OrientDB
have made them central to their designs. (See ACID and join support.)</p>
<p>Instead, most NoSQL databases offer a concept of &quot;eventual consistency&quot;
in which database changes are propagated to all nodes &quot;eventually&quot;
(typically within milliseconds) so queries for data might not return
updated data immediately or might result in reading data that is not
accurate, a problem known as stale reads. Additionally, some NoSQL
systems may exhibit lost writes and other forms of data loss. Some NoSQL
systems provide concepts such as write-ahead logging to avoid data
loss. For distributed transaction processing across multiple databases,
data consistency is an even bigger challenge that is difficult for both
NoSQL and relational databases. Even current relational databases &quot;do
not allow referential integrity constraints to span databases.&quot; There
are few systems that maintain both ACID transactions and X/Open XA
standards for distributed transaction processing.</p>

<p>Node B is the telecommunications node in particular mobile communication
networks, namely those that adhere to the UMTS standard. The Node B

<p>Node B corresponds to BTS (base transceiver station) in GSM.</p>
<p>Functionality<br />
This is the hardware that is connected to the mobile phone network that
communicates directly with mobile handsets. In contrast with GSM base
stations, Node B uses WCDMA/TD-SCDMA as the air interface technology. As
in all cellular systems, such as UMTS and GSM, the Node B contains radio
frequency transmitter(s) and the receiver(s) used to communicate
directly with mobile devices, which move freely around it. In this type
of cellular network, the mobile devices cannot communicate directly with
each other but have to communicate with the NodeB.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the Node Bs have minimum functionality, and are
controlled by an RNC (Radio Network Controller). However, this is
changing with the emergence of High Speed Downlink Packet Access
(HSDPA), where some logic (e.g., retransmission) is handled on the Node
B for lower response times.</p>

<p>Object-oriented</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the
concept of &quot;objects&quot;, which may contain data, in the form of fields,
often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often
known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures
can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which
they are associated (objects have a notion of &quot;this&quot; or &quot;self&quot;). In OOP,
computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that
interact with one another. There is significant diversity of OOP
languages, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that
objects are instances of classes, which typically also determine their
type.</p>
<p>Many of the most widely-used programming languages (such as C+, Object
Pascal, Java, Python etc.) are multi-paradigm programming languages that
support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree,
typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming.
Significant object-oriented languages include Java, C+, C#, Python,
PHP, Ruby, Perl, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala, Common
Lisp, and Smalltalk.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="opus"><a class="header" href="#opus">OPUS</a></h1>
<p>Opus is a lossy audio coding format developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation
and standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force, designed to
efficiently code speech and general audio in a single format, while
remaining low-latency enough for real-time interactive communication and
low-complexity enough for low-end embedded processors. Opus replaces
both Vorbis and Speex for new applications, and several blind listening
tests have ranked it higher-quality than any other standard audio format
at any given bitrate until transparency is reached, including MP3, AAC,
and HE-AAC.</p>
<p>Opus combines the speech-oriented linear predictive coding SILK
algorithm and the lower-latency, MDCT-based CELT algorithm, switching
between or combining them as needed for maximal efficiency. Bitrate,
audio bandwidth, complexity, and algorithm can all be adjusted
seamlessly in each frame. Opus has the low algorithmic delay (26.5 ms by
default) necessary for use as part of a real-time communication link,
permitting natural conversation, networked music performances, and live
lip sync; by trading-off quality or bitrate, the delay can be reduced
down to 5 ms. Its delay is exceptionally low compared to competing

<p>macOS (previously Mac OS X and later OS X) is a series of graphical
operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is
the primary operating system for Apple's Mac family of computers. Within
the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, it
is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems. The
first is colloquially called the &quot;classic&quot; Mac OS, which was introduced
in 1984, and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999. The first
desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, with its
first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. After this, Apple began
naming its releases after big cats, which lasted until OS X 10.8
Mountain Lion. Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks, releases have been named after
landmarks in California. Apple shortened the name to &quot;OS X&quot; in 2012 and
then changed it to &quot;macOS&quot; in 2016, adopting the nomenclature that they
were using for their other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
The latest version is macOS High Sierra, which was publicly released in
September 2017.</p>

<p>Open Shortest Path First</p>
<p>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet
Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and
falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating
within a single autonomous system (AS). It is defined as OSPF Version 2
in RFC 2328 (1998) for IPv4. The updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF
Version 3 in RFC 5340 (2008). OSPF supports the Classless Inter-Domain
Routing (CIDR) addressing model.</p>
<p>OSPF is a widely used IGP in large enterprise networks. IS-IS, another
LSR-based protocol, is more common in large service provider networks.</p>

<p>Operations support systems</p>
<p>Operations support systems (OSS), or operational support systems in
British usage, are computer systems used by telecommunications service
providers to manage their networks (e.g., telephone networks). They
support management functions such as network inventory, service
provisioning, network configuration and fault management.</p>
<p>Together with business support systems (BSS), they are used to support
various end-to-end telecommunication services. BSS and OSS have their
own data and service responsibilities. The two systems together are
often abbreviated OSS/BSS, BSS/OSS or simply B/OSS.</p>
<p>The abbreviation OSS is also used in a singular form to refer to all the
Operations Support Systems viewed as a whole system.</p>
<p>Different subdivisions of OSS have been proposed by the TM Forum,
industrial research labs or OSS vendors. In general, an OSS covers at
least the following five functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Network management systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service delivery</p>

<p>In computer networking, out-of-order delivery is the delivery of data
packets in a different order from which they were sent. Out-of-order
delivery can be caused by packets following multiple paths through a
network, or via parallel processing paths within network equipment that
are not designed to ensure that packet ordering is preserved. One of the
functions of TCP is to prevent the out-of-order delivery of data, either
by reassembling packets into order or forcing retries of out-of-order
packets.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="overlap-dialling"><a class="header" href="#overlap-dialling">Overlap Dialling</a></h1>
<p>Overlap dialing is required by CAS signaled lines. Overlap dial provides
for a longer time-out period between digits, also called the inter-digit
timer. With overlap dial set to off, the gateway expects to receive the
digits one right after the other coming in to this line with very little
delay between digits. With overlap dial set to on, then the device waits
up to about 2 seconds between digits.</p>
<p>Basically overlap dialing is a mechanism where a destination number can
be specified partially to complete the first stage of a routing path.
For example, if the number was &quot;23168104&quot;, it may be possible for the
telecom to dial &quot;23168&quot; to reach the first port of call as quickly as
possible (to save time on sending the remaining 3 digits) and then
deliver the remaining 3 digits &quot;104&quot; in overlap mode.</p>

<p>Password Authentication Protocol</p>
<p>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is a password-based
authentication protocol used by Point to Point Protocol (PPP) to
validate users. Almost all network operating system remote servers
support PAP.</p>
<p>PAP is considered a weak authentication scheme (weak schemes are simple
and have lighter computational overhead but are much more vulnerable to
attack; while weak schemes may have limited application in some
constrained environments, they are avoided in general). Among PAP's
deficiencies is the fact that it transmits unencrypted passwords over
the network. PAP is therefore used only as a last resort when the remote
server does not support a stronger scheme such as CHAP or EAP</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pcm"><a class="header" href="#pcm">PCM</a></h1>
<p>Pulse-code modulation</p>
<p>Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent
sampled analog signals. It is the standard form of digital audio in
computers, compact discs, digital telephony and other digital audio
applications. In a PCM stream, the amplitude of the analog signal is
sampled regularly at uniform intervals, and each sample is quantized to
the nearest value within a range of digital steps.</p>
<p>Linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) is a specific type of PCM where the
quantization levels are linearly uniform. This is in contrast to PCM
encodings where quantization levels vary as a function of amplitude (as
with the A-law algorithm or the μ-law algorithm). Though PCM is a more
general term, it is often used to describe data encoded as LPCM.</p>
<p>A PCM stream has two basic properties that determine the stream's
fidelity to the original analog signal: the sampling rate, which is the
number of times per second that samples are taken; and the bit depth,
which determines the number of possible digital values that can be used
to represent each sample.</p>

<p>Policy and Charging Rules Function</p>
<p>Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) is the software node
designated in real-time to determine policy rules in a multimedia
network. As a policy tool, the PCRF plays a central role in
next-generation networks. Unlike earlier policy engines that were added
onto an existing network to enforce policy, the PCRF is a software
component that operates at the network core and accesses subscriber
databases and other specialized functions, such as a charging system, in
a centralized manner. Because it operates in real time, the PCRF has an
increased strategic significance and broader potential role than
traditional policy engines. This has led to a proliferation of PCRF
products since 2008.</p>
<p>The PCRF is the part of the network architecture that aggregates
information to and from the network, operational support systems, and
other sources (such as portals) in real time, supporting the creation of
rules and then automatically making policy decisions for each subscriber
active on the network. Such a network might offer multiple services,
quality of service (QoS) levels, and charging rules. PCRF can provide a
network agnostic solution (wire line and wireless) and can also enable
multi-dimensional approach which helps in creating a lucrative and
innovative platform for operators. PCRF can also be integrated with
different platforms like billing, rating, charging, and subscriber
database or can also be deployed as a standalone entity.</p>
<p>PCRF plays a key role in VoLTE as a mediator of network resources for
the IP Multimedia Systems network for establishing the calls and
allocating the requested bandwidth to the call bearer with configured
attributes.</p>

<p>plesiochronous digital hierarchy</p>
<p>The plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) is a technology used in
telecommunications networks to transport large quantities of data over
digital transport equipment such as fibre optic and microwave radio
systems. The term plesiochronous is derived from Greek plēsios, meaning
near, and chronos, time, and refers to the fact that PDH networks run in
a state where different parts of the network are nearly, but not quite
perfectly, synchronized.</p>
<p>Backbone transport networks replaced PDH networks with synchronous
digital hierarchy (SDH) or synchronous optical networking (SONET)
equipment over the ten years ending around the turn of the millennium
(2000), whose floating payloads relaxed the more stringent timing
requirements of PDH network technology.</p>
<p>PDH allows transmission of data streams that are nominally running at
the same rate, but allowing some variation on the speed around a nominal
rate. By analogy, any two watches are nominally running at the same
rate, clocking up 60 seconds every minute. However, there is no link
between watches to guarantee that they run at exactly the same rate, and
it is highly likely that one is running slightly faster than the other.</p>

A PDU may contain user data or control information and network
addressing. In layered architectures of communication protocol stacks,
each layer implements protocols tailored to the specific type or mode of
data exchange, or network function of the layer. For example, the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) implements a connection-oriented
transfer mode, and the PDU of this protocol is called a segment, while
the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) uses datagrams as protocol data unit
for connection-less transfer. A layer lower in the Internet Protocol
Suite, at the Internet Layer, the PDU is called a packet, irrespective
of its payload type.<br />

<p>Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol</p>
<p>The Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol, also known as
Protected EAP or simply PEAP, is a protocol that encapsulates the
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) within an encrypted and
authenticated Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel. The purpose was to
correct deficiencies in EAP; EAP assumed a protected communication
channel, such as that provided by physical security, so facilities for
protection of the EAP conversation were not provided.</p>
<p>PEAP was jointly developed by Cisco Systems, Microsoft, and RSA
Security. PEAPv0 was the version included with Microsoft Windows XP and
was nominally defined in draft-kamath-pppext-peapv0-00. PEAPv1 and
PEAPv2 were defined in different versions of
draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap. PEAPv1 was defined in
draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-00 through
draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-05, and PEAPv2 was defined in
versions beginning with draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-06.</p>
<p>The protocol only specifies chaining multiple EAP mechanisms and not any
specific method. However, use of the EAP-MSCHAPv2 and EAP-GTC methods
are the most commonly supported<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="per"><a class="header" href="#per">PER</a></h1>
<p>Packed Encoding Rules</p>
<p>Packed Encoding Rules (PER) are ASN.1 encoding rules for producing a
compact transfer syntax for data structures described in ASN.1, defined
in 1994.</p>
<p>This Recommendation or International Standard describes a set of
encoding rules that can be applied to values of all ASN.1 types to
achieve a much more compact representation than that achieved by the BER
and its derivatives (described in ITU-T Rec. X.690 ISO/IEC 8825-1).</p>
<p>It uses additional information, such as the lower and upper limits for
numeric values, from the ASN.1 specification to represent the data units
using the minimum number of bits. The compactness requires that the
decoder knows the complete abstract syntax of the data structure to be
decoded, however.</p>
<p>There are two variations of packed encoding rules: unaligned and
aligned. With the unaligned encoding, the bits are packed with no regard
for octet (byte) boundaries. With aligned encoding, certain types of
data structures are aligned on octet boundaries, meaning there may be
some number of wasted padding bits. Unaligned encoding uses the least
number of bits, but presumably at some cost in processing time.</p>

Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced
by The PHP Group.[6] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but
it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
<p>PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in
combination with various web template systems, web content management
systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP
interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common
Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results
of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data,
including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be
executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to
implement standalone graphical applications.</p>
<p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free
software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and
can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and
platform, free of charge.</p>
<p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or
standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de

work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pll"><a class="header" href="#pll">PLL</a></h1>
<p>Phase Locked Loop</p>
<p>A phase-locked loop or phase lock loop abbreviated as PLL is a control
system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the
phase of an input signal. There are several different types; the
simplest is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency
oscillator and a phase detector in a feedback loop. The oscillator
generates a periodic signal, and the phase detector compares the phase
of that signal with the phase of the input periodic signal, adjusting
the oscillator to keep the phases matched.</p>
<p>Keeping the input and output phase in lock step also implies keeping the
input and output frequencies the same. Consequently, in addition to
synchronizing signals, a phase-locked loop can track an input frequency,
or it can generate a frequency that is a multiple of the input
frequency. These properties are used for computer clock synchronization,
demodulation, and frequency synthesis.</p>
<p>Phase-locked loops are widely employed in radio, telecommunications,
computers and other electronic applications. They can be used to
demodulate a signal, recover a signal from a noisy communication
channel, generate a stable frequency at multiples of an input frequency
(frequency synthesis), or distribute precisely timed clock pulses in
digital logic circuits such as microprocessors. Since a single
integrated circuit can provide a complete phase-locked-loop building
block, the technique is widely used in modern electronic devices, with
output frequencies from a fraction of a hertz up to many gigahertz.</p>

<p>Point-to-Point Protocol</p>
<p>In computer networking, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link
layer (layer 2) communications protocol used to establish a direct
connection between two nodes. It connects two routers directly without
any host or any other networking device in between. It can provide
connection authentication, transmission encryption,[1] and
compression.</p>
<p>PPP is used over many types of physical networks including serial cable,
phone line, trunk line, cellular telephone, specialized radio links, and
fiber optic links such as SONET. Internet service providers (ISPs) have
used PPP for customer dial-up access to the Internet, since IP packets
cannot be transmitted over a modem line on their own, without some data
link protocol.</p>
<p>Two derivatives of PPP, Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)
and Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA), are used most commonly by
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to establish a Digital Subscriber Line
(DSL) Internet service connection with customers.</p>

packets over the DSL connection to the ISP's IP network, and from there
to the rest of the Internet. A 2005 networking book noted that &quot;Most DSL
providers use PPPoE, which provides authentication, encryption, and
compression.&quot; Typical use of PPPoE involves leveraging the PPP
facilities for authenticating the user with a username and password,
predominately via the PAP protocol and less often via CHAP.</p>

features and relies on the Point-to-Point Protocol being tunneled to
implement security functionality. However, the most common PPTP
implementation shipping with the Microsoft Windows product families
implements various levels of authentication and encryption natively as
standard features of the Windows PPTP stack. The intended use of this
protocol is to provide security levels and remote access levels

<p>Public Switched Telephone Network</p>
<p>The public switched telephone network (PSTN) is the aggregate of the
world's circuit-switched telephone networks that are operated by
national, regional, or local telephony operators, providing
infrastructure and services for public telecommunication.<br />
The PSTN consists of telephone lines, fiber optic cables, microwave
transmission links, cellular networks, communications satellites, and
undersea telephone cables, all interconnected by switching centers, thus
allowing most telephones to communicate with each other.<br />
Originally a network of fixed-line analog telephone systems, the PSTN is
now almost entirely digital in its core network and includes mobile and
other networks, as well as fixed telephones<br />

<p>Precision Time Protocol</p>
<p>The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize
clocks throughout a computer network. On a local area network, it
achieves clock accuracy in the sub-microsecond range, making it suitable
for measurement and control systems.</p>
<p>PTP was originally defined in the IEEE 1588-2002 standard, officially
entitled &quot;Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for
Networked Measurement and Control Systems&quot; and published in 2002. In
2008, IEEE 1588-2008 was released as a revised standard; also known as
PTP Version 2, it improves accuracy, precision and robustness but is not
backward compatible with the original 2002 version.</p>
<p>&quot;IEEE 1588 is designed to fill a niche not well served by either of the
two dominant protocols, NTP and GPS. IEEE 1588 is designed for local
systems requiring accuracies beyond those attainable using NTP. It is
also designed for applications that cannot bear the cost of a GPS
receiver at each node, or for which GPS signals are inaccessible.&quot;</p>

efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices
using structured programming and data structuring. It is named in honor
of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal.</p>
<p>Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language. Wirth had
already developed several improvements to this language as part of the
ALGOL X proposals, but these were not accepted and Pascal was developed
separately and released in 1970. A derivative known as Object Pascal
designed for object-oriented programming was developed in 1985; this was
used by Apple Computer and Borland in the late 1980s and later developed
into Delphi on the Microsoft Windows platform. Extensions to the Pascal
concepts led to the Pascal-like languages Modula-2 and Oberon</p>

<p>Penetration Testing</p>
<p>A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test, is an authorized
simulated attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the
security of the system. The test is performed to identify both
weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the
potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's
features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment
to be completed.</p>
<p>The process typically identifies the target systems and a particular
goal---then reviews available information and undertakes various means
to attain the goal. A penetration test target may be a white box (which
provides background and system information) or black box (which provides
only basic or no information except the company name). A penetration
test can help determine whether a system is vulnerable to attack if the
defenses were sufficient, and which defenses (if any) the test defeated.</p>
<p>Security issues that the penetration test uncovers should be reported to
the system owner. Penetration test reports may also assess potential
impacts to the organization and suggest countermeasures to reduce risk.</p>
<p>The goals of a penetration test vary depending on the type of approved
activity for any given engagement with the primary goal focused on
finding vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a nefarious actor and
informing the client of those vulnerabilities along with recommended
mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Penetration tests are a component of a full security audit. For example,
the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requires penetration
testing on a regular schedule, and after system changes.</p>
<p>Flaw hypothesis methodology is a systems analysis and penetration
prediction technique where a list of hypothesized flaws in a software
system are compiled through analysis of the specifications and
documentation for the system. The list of hypothesized flaws is then
prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a flaw
actually exists, and on the ease of exploiting it to the extent of
control or compromise. The prioritized list is used to direct the actual
testing of the system.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="perl"><a class="header" href="#perl">Perl</a></h1>
<p>Perl is a family of two high-level, general-purpose, interpreted,
dynamic programming languages, Perl 5 and Perl 6.</p>
<p>Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms
in use, including &quot;Practical Extraction and Reporting Language&quot;. Perl
was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix
scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has
undergone many changes and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign
of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both
languages continue to be developed independently by different
development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another.</p>
<p>The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages
including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed; Wall also alludes to Basic
and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl (Schwartz &amp; Christiansen)
and so on. They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary
data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools,
facilitating manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread
popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to
its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.</p>

<p>Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based
on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.</p>
<p>Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution
model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the
sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other
paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such
as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by
the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and
grammar.</p>
<p>Common programming paradigms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>imperative which allows side effects,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>object-oriented which groups code together with the state the
code modifies,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>procedural which groups code into functions,</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>declarative which does not state the order in which operations
execute,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>functional which disallows side effects,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>logic which has a particular style of execution model coupled to
a particular style of syntax and grammar, and</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>symbolic programming which has a particular style of syntax and
grammar.</p>
<p>For example, languages that fall into the imperative paradigm have
two main features: they state the order in which operations occur,
with constructs that explicitly control that order, and they allow
side effects, in which state can be modified at one point in time,
within one unit of code, and then later read at a different point in
time inside a different unit of code. The communication between the
units of code is not explicit. Meanwhile, in object-oriented
programming, code is organized into objects that contain state that
is only modified by the code that is part of the object. Most
object-oriented languages are also imperative languages. In
contrast, languages that fit the declarative paradigm do not state
the order in which to execute operations. Instead, they supply a
number of operations that are available in the system, along with
the conditions under which each is allowed to execute. The
implementation of the language's execution model tracks which
operations are free to execute and chooses the order on its own.

<p>Python is an interpreted high-level programming
language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum
and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that
emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It
provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and
large scales. In July 2018, the creator Van Rossum stepped down as the
leader in the language community after 30 years.</p>
<p>Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive
standard library</p>
<p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 and had many
major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and
support for Unicode. With this release, the development process became
more transparent and community-backed.</p>
<p>Python 3.0 (initially called Python 3000 or py3k) was released on 3
December 2008 after a long testing period. It is a major revision of the
language that is not completely backward-compatible with previous
versions. However, many of its major features have been backported to
the Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series, and releases of Python 3
include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2

<p>A packet analyzer (also known as a packet sniffer) is a computer program
or piece of computer hardware (such as a packet capture appliance) that
can intercept and log traffic that passes over a digital network or part
of a network. Packet capture is the process of intercepting and logging
traffic. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures
each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the
values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content
according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.</p>
<p>A packet analyzer used for intercepting traffic on wireless networks is
known as a wireless analyzer or WiFi analyzer. A packet analyzer can
also be referred to as a network analyzer or protocol analyzer though
these terms also have other meanings.</p>
<p>Capabilities<br />
On wired shared medias networks, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI
networks, depending on the network structure (hub or switch), it may be
possible to capture all traffic on the network from a single machine on
the network. On modern networks, traffic can be captured using a network
switch with a so-called monitoring port that mirrors all packets that
pass through designated ports of the switch. A network tap is an even
more reliable solution than to use a monitoring port, since taps are
less likely to drop packets during high traffic load.</p>
<p>On wireless LANs, traffic can be captured on one channel at a time, or
by using multiple adapters, on several channels simultaneously.</p>
<p>On wired broadcast and wireless LANs, to capture unicast traffic between
other machines, the network adapter capturing the traffic must be in
promiscuous mode. On wireless LANs, even if the adapter is in
promiscuous mode, packets not for the service set the adapter is
configured for are usually ignored. To see those packets, the adapter
must be in monitor mode. No special provisions are required to capture
multicast traffic to a multicast group the packet analyzer is already
monitoring, or broadcast traffic.</p>
<p>When traffic is captured, either the entire contents of packets are
recorded, or just the headers are recorded. Recording just headers
reduces storage requirements, and avoids some legal issues, yet often
provides sufficient information to diagnose problems.</p>
<p>Captured information is decoded from raw digital form into a
human-readable format that lets users easily review exchanged
information. Protocol analyzers vary in their abilities to display and
analyze data.</p>
<p>Some protocol analyzers can also generate traffic and thus act as the
reference device. These can act as protocol testers. Such testers
generate protocol-correct traffic for functional testing, and may also
have the ability to deliberately introduce errors to test the DUT's
ability to handle errors.</p>
<p>Protocol analyzers can also be hardware-based, either in probe format
or, as is increasingly common, combined with a disk array. These devices
record packets (or a slice of the packet) to a disk array. This allows
historical forensic analysis of packets without users having to recreate

<p>ITU-T Recommendation Q.931 is the ITU standard ISDN connection control
signalling protocol, forming part of Digital Subscriber Signalling
System No. 1. Unlike connectionless systems like UDP, ISDN is connection
oriented and uses explicit signalling to manage call state: Q.931. Q.931
typically does not carry user data. Q.931 does not have a direct
equivalent in the Internet Protocol stack, but can be compared to SIP.
Q.931 does not provide flow control or perform retransmission, since the
underlying layers are assumed to be reliable and the circuit-oriented
nature of ISDN allocates bandwidth in fixed increments of 64 kbit/s.
Amongst other things, Q.931 manages connection setup and breakdown. Like
TCP, Q.931 documents both the protocol itself and a protocol state
machine.</p>
<p>Q.931 was designed for ISDN call establishment, maintenance, and release
of network connections between two DTEs on the ISDN D channel. Q.931 has
more recently been used as part of the VoIP H.323 protocol stack (see
H.225.0) and in modified form in some mobile phone transmission systems
and in ATM.</p>
<p>A Q.931 frame contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protocol discriminator (PD) -- Specifies which signaling protocol is
used for the connection (e.g. PD=8 for DSS1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call reference value (CR) -- Addresses different connections which
can exist simultaneously. The value is valid only during the actual
time period of the connection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message type (MT) -- Specifies the type of a layer 3 message out of
the Q.931-defined Message type set for call control (e.g. SETUP).
There are messages defined for the call setup, the call release and
the control of call features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information elements (IE) -- Specify further information which is
associated to the actual message. An IE contains the IE name
(e.g. bearer capability), their length and a variable field of
contents.</p>

<p>Quadrature Amplitude Modulation</p>
<p>Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is the name of a family of digital
modulation methods and a related family of analog modulation methods
widely used in modern telecommunications to transmit information. It
conveys two analog message signals, or two digital bit streams, by
changing (modulating) the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the
amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or amplitude
modulation (AM) analog modulation scheme. The two carrier waves of the
same frequency are out of phase with each other by 90°, a condition
known as orthogonality or quadrature. The transmitted signal is created
by adding the two carrier waves together. At the receiver, the two waves
can be coherently separated (demodulated) because of their orthogonality
property. Another key property is that the modulations are
low-frequency/low-bandwidth waveforms compared to the carrier frequency,
which is known as the narrowband assumption.</p>
<p>Phase modulation (analog PM) and phase-shift keying (digital PSK) can be
regarded as a special case of QAM, where the amplitude of the
transmitted signal is a constant, but its phase varies. This can also be
extended to frequency modulation (FM) and frequency-shift keying (FSK),
for these can be regarded as a special case of phase modulation.</p>
<p>QAM is used extensively as a modulation scheme for digital
telecommunication systems, such as in 802.11 Wi-Fi standards.
Arbitrarily high spectral efficiencies can be achieved with QAM by
setting a suitable constellation size, limited only by the noise level
and linearity of the communications channel.  QAM is being used in
optical fiber systems as bit rates increase; QAM16 and QAM64 can be
optically emulated with a 3-path interferometer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="qsig"><a class="header" href="#qsig">QSIG</a></h1>
<p>QSIG is an ISDN based signaling protocol for signaling between private
branch exchanges (PBXs) in a private integrated services network (PISN).
It makes use of the connection-level Q.931 protocol and the
application-level ROSE protocol. ISDN &quot;proper&quot; functions as the physical
link layer.</p>
<p>QSIG was originally developed by Ecma International, adopted by ETSI and
is defined by a set of ISO standard documents, so is not owned by any
company. This allows interoperability between communications platforms
provided by disparate vendors.</p>
<p>QSIG has two layers, called BC (basic call) and GF (generic function).
QSIG BC describes how to set up calls between PBXs. QSIG GF provides
supplementary services for large-scale corporate, educational, and
government networks, such as line identification, call intrusion and
call forwarding. Thus for a large or very distributed company that
requires multiple PBXs, users can receive the same services across the
network and be unaware of the switch that their telephone is connected
to. This greatly eases the problems of management of large networks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="qos"><a class="header" href="#qos">QoS</a></h1>
<p>Quality of Service</p>
<p>Quality of service (QoS) is the description or measurement of the
overall performance of a service, such as a telephony or computer
network or a cloud computing service, particularly the performance seen
by the users of the network. To quantitatively measure quality of
service, several related aspects of the network service are often
considered, such as packet loss, bit rate, throughput, transmission
delay, availability, jitter, etc.</p>
<p>In the field of computer networking and other packet-switched
telecommunication networks, quality of service refers to traffic
prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than
the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to
provide different priority to different applications, users, or data
flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow.</p>
<p>Quality of service is particularly important for the transport of
traffic with special requirements. In particular, developers have
introduced Voice over IP technology to allow computer networks to become
as useful as telephone networks for audio conversations, as well as
supporting new applications with even stricter network performance
requirements.</p>

<p>radio access network</p>
<p>A radio access network (RAN) is part of a mobile telecommunication
system. It implements a radio access technology. Conceptually, it
resides between a device such as a mobile phone, a computer, or any
remotely controlled machine and provides connection with its core
network (CN). Depending on the standard, mobile phones and other
wireless connected devices are varyingly known as user equipment (UE),
terminal equipment, mobile station (MS), etc. RAN functionality is
typically provided by a silicon chip residing in both the core network
as well as the user equipment.</p>
<p>Examples of radio access network types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GRAN: GSM radio access network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GERAN: essentially the same as GRAN but specifying the inclusion of
EDGE packet radio services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTRAN: UMTS radio access network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E-UTRAN: The Long Term Evolution (LTE) high speed and low latency
radio access network</p>
<p>It is also possible for a single handset/phone to be simultaneously
connected to multiple radio access networks. Handsets capable of
this are sometimes called dual-mode handsets. For instance it is
common for handsets to support both GSM and UMTS (a.k.a. &quot;3G&quot;) radio
access technologies. Such devices seamlessly transfer an ongoing
call between different radio access networks without the user
noticing any disruption in service.<br />

<p>Radio Access Network Application Part</p>
<p>In telecommunications networks, RANAP (an acronym for Radio Access
Network Application Part) is a protocol specified by 3GPP in TS 25.413
and used in UMTS for signaling between the Core Network, which can be a
MSC or SGSN, and the UTRAN. RANAP is carried over Iu-interface.</p>
<p>RANAP signalling protocol resides in the control plane of Radio network
layer of Iu interface in the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication
System) protocol stack. Iu interface is the interface between RNC (Radio
Network Controller) and CN (Core Network). nb. For Iu-ps transport RANAP
is carried on SCTP if IP interface used on this.</p>
<p>RANAP handles signaling for the Iu-PS - RNC and 3G SGSN and Iu-CS - RNC
and 3G MSC . It also provides the signaling channel to transparently
pass messages between the User Equipment (UE) and the CN.</p>

<p>Dynamic IP Address Allocation -- Reverse Address Resolution protocol</p>
<p>The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is an obsolete computer
networking protocol used by a client computer to request its Internet
Protocol (IPv4) address from a computer network, when all it has
available is its link layer or hardware address, such as a MAC address.
The client broadcasts the request and does not need prior knowledge of
the network topology or the identities of servers capable of fulfilling
its request.</p>
<p>RARP is described in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) publication
RFC 903. It has been rendered obsolete by the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
and the modern Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which both
support a much greater feature set than RARP.</p>
<p>RARP requires one or more server hosts to maintain a database of
mappings of Link Layer addresses to their respective protocol addresses.
Media Access Control (MAC) addresses need to be individually configured
on the servers by an administrator. RARP is limited to serving only IP
addresses.</p>
<p>Reverse ARP differs from the Inverse Address Resolution Protocol (InARP)
described in RFC 2390, which is designed to obtain the IP address
associated with a local Frame Relay data link connection identifier.
InARP is not used in Ethernet.</p>
<p>Modern Day Uses<br />
Although the original uses for RARP have been overcome by different
protocols, some modern day protocols use RARP. Examples are:</p>
<p>Cisco's Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV). RARP is used to update
the layer 2 forwarding tables when a MAC address moves between data
centers.</p>

users based on available bandwidth, and the tracking of the status of
all users. Formally, RAS is part of the H.225 protocol for H.323

<p>relational database management system</p>
<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management
system (DBMS) based on the relational model invented by Edgar F. Codd at
IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. Most databases in widespread use
today are based on his relational database model.</p>
<p>RDBMSs have been a common choice for the storage of information in
databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical
information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s.
Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases
and network databases because they were easier to implement and
administer. Nonetheless, relational databases received continued,
unsuccessful challenges by object database management systems in the
1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the
so-called object-relational impedance mismatch between relational
databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by XML
database management systems in the 1990s. However, due to the expanse of
technologies, such as horizontal scaling of computer clusters, NoSQL
databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS
databases<br />

<p>Representational State Transfer</p>
<p>Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that
defines a set of constraints and properties based on HTTP. Web Services
that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services,
provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.
REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and
manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform
and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of web services,
such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of
operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Web resources&quot; were first defined on the World Wide Web as documents or
files identified by their URLs. However, today they have a much more
generic and abstract definition that encompasses everything or entity
that can be identified, named, addressed, or handled, in any way
whatsoever, on the web. In a RESTful web service, requests made to a
resource's URI will elicit a response that may be in HTML, XML, JSON, or
some other format. The response may confirm that some alteration has
been made to the stored resource, and the response may provide hypertext
links to other related resources or collections of resources. When HTTP
is used, as is most common, the operations available are GET, POST, PUT,
DELETE, and other predefined CRUD HTTP methods.</p>
<p>By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, REST systems
aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow, by
re-using components that can be managed and updated without affecting
the system as a whole, even while it is running.</p>

<p>Routing Information Protocol</p>
<p>The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest
distance-vector routing protocols which employ the hop count as a
routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on
the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The
largest number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of
networks that RIP can support.</p>
<p>RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown
mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being
propagated.</p>
<p>In RIPv1 router broadcast updates with their routing table every 30
seconds. In the early deployments, routing tables were small enough that
the traffic was not significant. As networks grew in size, however, it
became evident there could be a massive traffic burst every 30 seconds,
even if the routers had been initialized at random times.</p>
<p>In most networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice for
routing as its time to converge and scalability are poor compared to
EIGRP, OSPF, or IS-IS. However, it is easy to configure, because RIP
does not require any parameters unlike other protocols.</p>
<p>RIP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport protocol, and
is assigned the reserved port number 520.</p>

<p>Radio Network Controller</p>
<p>The Radio Network Controller (or RNC) is a governing element in the UMTS
radio access network (UTRAN) and is responsible for controlling the Node
Bs that are connected to it. The RNC carries out radio resource
management, some of the mobility management functions and is the point
where encryption is done before user data is sent to and from the
mobile. The RNC connects to the Circuit Switched Core Network through
Media Gateway (MGW) and to the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) in the
Packet Switched Core Network.<br />
Interfaces</p>
<p>RNC Interfaces<br />
The logical connections between the network elements are known as
interfaces. The interface between the RNC and the Circuit Switched Core
Network (CS-CN) is called Iu-CS and between the RNC and the Packet
Switched Core Network is called Iu-PS. Other interfaces include Iub
(between the RNC and the Node B) and Iur (between RNCs in the same
network). Iu interfaces carry user traffic (such as voice or data) as
well as control information (see Protocols), and Iur interface is mainly
needed for soft handovers involving 2 RNCs though not required as the
absence of Iur will cause these handovers to become hard handovers.<br />
<img src="Glossary/r/./images/15008901.png?width=480" alt="" /></p>

<p>Signalling protocol responsible for the control of the Node B by the
RNC is called NBAP (Node-B Application Part). NBAP is subdivided

NBAP controls overall Node B functionality and Dedicated NBAP
controls separate cells or sectors of the Node B. NBAP is carried
over Iub. In order for NBAP to handle common and dedicated

handles common NBAP procedures and Communication Control Port (CCP)
which handles dedicated NBAP procedures.</p>

<p>In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a
computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a
different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared
network), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call,
without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote
interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code
whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote.
This is a form of client--server interaction (caller is client, executor
is server), typically implemented via a request--response
message-passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPC
calls are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model
implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures
is largely the same whether it is local or remote, but usually they are
not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls.
Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable
than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.</p>
<p>RPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different
processes have different address spaces: if on the same host machine,
they have distinct virtual address spaces, even though the physical
address space is the same; while if they are on different hosts, the

<p>Radio Resource Control</p>
<p>The Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol is used in UMTS and LTE on the
Air interface. It is a layer that exists between UE and eNB and exists
at the IP level. This protocol is specified by 3GPP in TS 25.331 for
UMTS and in TS 36.331 for LTE. RRC messages are transported via the
PDCP-Protocol.</p>
<p>The major functions of the RRC protocol include connection establishment
and release functions, broadcast of system information, radio bearer
establishment, reconfiguration and release, RRC connection mobility
procedures, paging notification and release and outer loop power
control. By means of the signalling functions the RRC configures the
user and control planes according to the network status and allows for
Radio Resource Management strategies to be implemented.</p>
<p>The operation of the RRC is guided by a state machine which defines
certain specific states that a UE may be present in. The different
states in this state machine have different amounts of radio resources
associated with them and these are the resources that the UE may use
when it is present in a given specific state. Since different amounts of
resources are available at different states the quality of the service
that the user experiences and the energy consumption of the UE are
influenced by this state machine.</p>
<p>In order to comprehend the Radio Resource Control (RRC) state machine,
we should study the architecture of the third generation mobile cellular
system, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The UMTS
is composed by two subsystems, the UTRAN (Umts Terrestrial Radio Access
Network) and CN (core network) :<br />
<img src="Glossary/r/./images/15008913.png?width=491" alt="" /></p>
<p>The RNC is responsible for the packet scheduling, radio resource control
and handover control.<br />
Unlike other wireless technologies like WIFI in which clients
concurrently send packets and collisions occur (and backoff algorithms),
in the UMTS there is a centralized entity that schedules resources to
each client. In order to manage the UE access to radio resources, the
UMTS introduces a radio resource control protocol (RRC) that attributes
each UE a specific state machine (based on radio resource usage). This
state machine is dependent on the 3G provider and can have different
states and/or transitions. According to the reference paper --
Characterizing Radio Resource Allocation for 3G Networks -- the studied
networks were composed by three states: IDLE, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH.<br />
In truth other states can actually be observed in some operators before
going into a disconnected mode. For example the PCH states -- URA_PCH
and CELL_PCH -- are states in which the user equipment has no transport
channels allocated but has to monitor the cell/UTRAN it is currently
connected to in order to send CELL_UPDATES to the RCN (just in case it
actually changes). This update implies temporarily changing the state to
a CELL_FACH in order to be able to send data. The change from
CELL_PCH, in which the UE is known at a cell level, to URA_PCH, in
which the user is known at UTRAN level, may be due to an increasing
number of CELL_UPDATES (e.g. travelling fast). This is useful in order
to speed up incoming connections since it might take around 0.9 seconds
to establish it against the 2.5s delay if the UE is on the IDLE state.<br />
Below is a diagram that represents the six most common states --
CELL_DCH, CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH, IDLE, DISCONNECT -- and some
of the possible transitions.<br />

<p>Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol</p>
<p>In 2001, the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) as
802.1w. RSTP provides significantly faster spanning tree convergence
after a topology change, introducing new convergence behaviors and
bridge port roles to do this. RSTP was designed to be
backwards-compatible with standard STP.</p>
<p>While STP can take 30 to 50 seconds to respond to a topology change,
RSTP is typically able to respond to changes within 3 × Hello times
(default: 3 times 2 seconds) or within a few milliseconds of a physical
link failure. The Hello time is an important and configurable time
interval that is used by RSTP for several purposes; its default value is
2 seconds.</p>
<p>Standard IEEE 802.1D-2004 incorporates RSTP and obsoletes the original
STP standard.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rsvp"><a class="header" href="#rsvp">RSVP</a></h1>
<p>Resource Reservation Protocol</p>
<p>The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is a transport layer protocol
designed to reserve resources across a network for quality of service
(QoS) using the integrated services model. RSVP operates over an IPv4 or
IPv6 and provides receiver-initiated setup of resource reservations for
multicast or unicast data flows. It does not transport application data
but is similar to a control protocol, like Internet Control Message
Protocol (ICMP) or Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). RSVP is
described in RFC 2205.</p>
<p>RSVP can be used by hosts and routers to request or deliver specific
levels of QoS for application data streams or flows. RSVP defines how
applications place reservations and how they can relinquish the reserved
resources once no longer required. RSVP operation will generally result
in resources being reserved in each node along a path. RSVP is not a
routing protocol and was designed to interoperate with current and
future routing protocols.</p>
<p>RSVP by itself is rarely deployed in telecommunications networks
today[citation needed] but, as of February 2003, the traffic
engineering extension of RSVP, or RSVP-TE, is becoming more widely
accepted nowadays in many QoS-oriented networks. Next Steps in Signaling
(NSIS) is a proposed replacement for RSVP.</p>

<p>Real-Time Control Protocol</p>
<p>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is a sister protocol of the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP). Its basic functionality and packet structure
is defined in RFC 3550. RTCP provides out-of-band statistics and control
information for an RTP session. It partners with RTP in the delivery and
packaging of multimedia data, but does not transport any media data
itself.</p>
<p>The primary function of RTCP is to provide feedback on the quality of
service (QoS) in media distribution by periodically sending statistics
information such as transmitted octet and packet counts, packet loss,
packet delay variation, and round-trip delay time to participants in a
streaming multimedia session. An application may use this information to
control quality of service parameters, perhaps by limiting flow, or
using a different codec.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rtos"><a class="header" href="#rtos">RTOS</a></h1>
<p>A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS) intended
to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in,
typically without buffer delays. Processing time requirements (including
any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of
time. A real time system is a time bound system which has well defined
fixed time constraints. Processing must be done within the defined
constraints or the system will fail. They either are event driven or
time sharing. Event driven systems switch between tasks based on their
priorities while time sharing systems switch the task based on clock
interrupts. Most RTOS's use a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.</p>
<p>A key characteristic of an RTOS is the level of its consistency
concerning the amount of time it takes to accept and complete an
application's task; the variability is jitter. A hard real-time
operating system has less jitter than a soft real-time operating system.
The chief design goal is not high throughput, but rather a guarantee of
a soft or hard performance category. An RTOS that can usually or
generally meet a deadline is a soft real-time OS, but if it can meet a
deadline deterministically it is a hard real-time OS.</p>
<p>An RTOS has an advanced algorithm for scheduling. Scheduler flexibility
enables a wider, computer-system orchestration of process priorities,
but a real-time OS is more frequently dedicated to a narrow set of
applications. Key factors in a real-time OS are minimal interrupt
latency and minimal thread switching latency; a real-time OS is valued
more for how quickly or how predictably it can respond than for the
amount of work it can perform in a given period of time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rtp"><a class="header" href="#rtp">RTP</a></h1>
<p>Real-time Protocol</p>
<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a network protocol for
delivering audio and video over IP networks. RTP is used extensively in
communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media,
such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC,
television services and web-based push-to-talk features.</p>
<p>RTP typically runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). RTP is used in
conjunction with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). While RTP carries the
media streams (e.g., audio and video), RTCP is used to monitor
transmission statistics and quality of service (QoS) and aids
synchronization of multiple streams. RTP is one of the technical
foundations of Voice over IP and in this context is often used in
conjunction with a signalling protocol such as the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) which establishes connections across the network.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rtsp"><a class="header" href="#rtsp">RTSP</a></h1>
<p>Real Time Streaming Protocol</p>
<p>The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol
designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control
streaming media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and
controlling media sessions between end points. Clients of media servers
issue VCR-style commands, such as play, record and pause, to facilitate
real-time control of the media streaming from the server to a client
(Video On Demand) or from a client to the server (Voice Recording).</p>
<p>The transmission of streaming data itself is not a task of RTSP. Most
RTSP servers use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in conjunction
with Real-time Control Protocol (RTCP) for media stream delivery.</p>

<p>A risk-reward analysis is a very simple tool which can help you assess
the risk and reward profile of completely different options. It works in
the same way as a risk-return analysis which you may already be familiar
with.<br />
It can be applied at any level, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>by a CEO for comparing different strategic directions for the
company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by a program manager deciding which projects to keep within the
program and which to discard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by a project manager deciding how to sequence tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or simply by an individual team member deciding how best to spend
their day.</p>
<p>The template works by having risk plotted along one axis and reward
along the other. In the diagram below I've divided the template into
four sections to show you how to interpret the information.</p>
<p><img src="Glossary/r/./images/15008883.png?width=215" alt="" /><br />
The four categories from the diagram above are as follows:</p>
<p>Equal Low: where risk and reward are both proportional and low.<br />
Equal High: where risk and reward are both proportional and high.<br />
Positive: represents a positive risk-reward balance, where a higher
return can be achieved with limited risk.<br />
Negative: represents a negative risk-reward balance, where a low
return is the reward for taking on a relatively high risk.<br />
How to Use it<br />
First, you need to create a list of all the different options and
their possible rewards. This can done quickly and roughly, or can
involve serious effort (market research, scenario development etc)
-- the effort you put in will depend on the size of the decision you
are making. Examples of some options might include: outsourcing
non-core activities, stop investing in poorly performing product
lines, invest in new products, or investing to move into new
markets. Once you have all the options and their potential reward,
they should be plotted on the risk-reward chart:<br />
<img src="Glossary/r/./images/15008889.png?width=262" alt="" /><br />
At this stage some options will appear to have a more favourable
risk-reward profile than others, such as outsourcing in the above
example, but it is work taking the time to investigate whether any
options can have their risks mitigated, or if there are options that
can have their rewards boosted, before making a final decision on
which option to go with. In the above example, if the risk of
developing new products could be mitigated somehow then that option
would become more favourable than outsourcing.</p>
<p>Finally, for an even more complete picture to further aid our
decision making, we can add resources to the risk-reward template.
In the diagram below, the bigger the bubble the more resources are
required to execute that option.<br />
<img src="Glossary/r/./images/15008895.png?width=267" alt="" /><br />
With risk, reward, and resources all plotted, we are able to trade
them against one another to find the best option for us. From the
diagram above you can see that outsourcing is probably the most
favourable option, providing plenty of upside reward but requiring
minimal resource and having little risk. Additionally, with so few
resources engaged in making the outsourcing happen, perhaps some
investigative work can start on the new product development option
with some of the spare resource.</p>

<p>Round-robin (RR) is one of the algorithms employed by process and
network schedulers in computing. As the term is generally used, time
slices (also known as time quanta) are assigned to each process in equal
portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority
(also known as cyclic executive). Round-robin scheduling is simple, easy
to implement, and starvation-free. Round-robin scheduling can also be
applied to other scheduling problems, such as data packet scheduling in
computer networks. It is an operating system concept.</p>
<p>The name of the algorithm comes from the round-robin principle known
from other fields, where each person takes an equal share of something
in turn.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="router"><a class="header" href="#router">Router</a></h1>
<p>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between
computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on
the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or
email, is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded
from one router to another router through the networks that constitute
an internetwork until it reaches its destination node.</p>
<p>A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks.
When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the
network address information in the packet to determine the ultimate
destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing
policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.</p>
<p>The most familiar type of routers are home and small office routers that
simply forward IP packets between the home computers and the Internet.
An example of a router would be the owner's cable or DSL router, which
connects to the Internet through an Internet service provider (ISP).
More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, connect large
business or ISP networks up to the powerful core routers that forward
data at high speed along the optical fiber lines of the Internet
backbone. Though routers are typically dedicated hardware devices,
software-based routers also exist</p>

<p>Single-carrier FDMA</p>
<p>Single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) is a frequency-division multiple access
scheme. It is also called Linearly precoded OFDMA (LP-OFDMA). Like other
multiple access schemes (TDMA, FDMA, CDMA, OFDMA), it deals with the
assignment of multiple users to a shared communication resource. SC-FDMA
can be interpreted as a linearly precoded OFDMA scheme, in the sense
that it has an additional DFT processing step preceding the conventional
OFDMA processing.<br />
SC-FDMA has drawn great attention as an attractive alternative to OFDMA,
especially in the uplink communications where lower peak-to-average
power ratio (PAPR) greatly benefits the mobile terminal in terms of
transmit power efficiency and reduced cost of the power amplifier. It
has been adopted as the uplink multiple access scheme in 3GPP Long Term
Evolution (LTE), or Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA).</p>

<p>Synchronous Digital Hierarchy</p>
<p>Synchronous optical networking (SONET) and synchronous digital hierarchy
(SDH) are standardized protocols that transfer multiple digital bit
streams synchronously over optical fiber using lasers or highly coherent
light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs). At low transmission rates data
can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The method was
developed to replace the plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) system
for transporting large amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over
the same fiber without synchronization problems.</p>
<p>SONET and SDH, which are essentially the same, were originally designed
to transport circuit mode communications (e.g., DS1, DS3) from a variety
of different sources, but they were primarily designed to support
real-time, uncompressed, circuit-switched voice encoded in PCM
format.[1] The primary difficulty in doing this prior to SONET/SDH was
that the synchronization sources of these various circuits were
different. This meant that each circuit was actually operating at a
slightly different rate and with different phase. SONET/SDH allowed for
the simultaneous transport of many different circuits of differing
origin within a single framing protocol. SONET/SDH is not a
communications protocol in itself, but a transport protocol.</p>
<p>Due to SONET/SDH's essential protocol neutrality and transport-oriented
features, SONET/SDH was the obvious choice for transporting the fixed
length Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames also known as cells. It
quickly evolved mapping structures and concatenated payload containers
to transport ATM connections. In other words, for ATM (and eventually
other protocols such as Ethernet), the internal complex structure
previously used to transport circuit-oriented connections was removed
and replaced with a large and concatenated frame (such as STS-3c) into
which ATM cells, IP packets, or Ethernet frames are placed.</p>

<p>Space-division multiple access</p>
<p>Space-division multiple access (SDMA) is a channel access method based
on creating parallel spatial pipes[clarification needed] next to
higher capacity pipes through spatial multiplexing and/or diversity, by
which it is able to offer superior performance in radio multiple access
communication systems.[clarification needed] In traditional mobile
cellular network systems, the base station has no information on the
position of the mobile units within the cell and radiates the signal in
all directions within the cell in order to provide radio coverage. This
results in wasting power on transmissions when there are no mobile units
to reach, in addition to causing interference for adjacent cells using
the same frequency, so called co-channel cells. Likewise, in reception,
the antenna receives signals coming from all directions including noise
and interference signals. By using smart antenna technology and
differing spatial locations of mobile units within the cell,
space-division multiple access techniques offer attractive performance
enhancements. The radiation pattern of the base station, both in
transmission and reception, is adapted to each user to obtain highest
gain in the direction of that user. This is often done using phased
array techniques.</p>
<p>In GSM cellular networks, the base station is aware of the distance (but
not direction) of a mobile phone by use of a technique called &quot;timing
advance&quot; (TA). The base transceiver station (BTS) can determine how far
the mobile station (MS) is by interpreting the reported TA. This
information, along with other parameters, can then be used to power down
the BTS or MS, if a power control feature is implemented in the network.
The power control in either BTS or MS is implemented in most modern
networks, especially on the MS, as this ensures a better battery life
for the MS. This is also why having a BTS close to the user results in
less exposure to electromagnetic radiation.</p>

<p>Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is an approach to cloud
computing that facilitates network management and enables
programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve
network performance and monitoring. SDN is meant to address the fact
that the static architecture of traditional networks is decentralized
and complex while current networks require more flexibility and easy
troubleshooting. SDN suggests to centralize network intelligence in one
network component by disassociating the forwarding process of network
packets (data plane) from the routing process (control plane). The
control plane consists of one or more controllers which are considered
as the brain of SDN network where the whole intelligence is
incorporated. However, the intelligence centralization has its own
drawbacks when it comes to security, scalability and elasticity and this
is the main issue of SDN</p>

between endpoints for negotiation of media type, format, and all
associated properties. The set of properties and parameters are often
called a session profile.</p>
<p>SDP is designed to be extensible to support new media types and formats.
SDP started off as a component of the Session Announcement Protocol
(SAP), but found other uses in conjunction with Real-time Transport

weaknesses were discovered in SHA-1, and the standard was no longer
approved for most cryptographic uses after 2010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHA-2: A family of two similar hash functions, with different block
sizes, known as SHA-256 and SHA-512. They differ in the word size;
SHA-256 uses 32-bit words where SHA-512 uses 64-bit words. There are
also truncated versions of each standard, known as SHA-224, SHA-384,
SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256. These were also designed by the NSA.</p>

<p>Subscriber Identity Module</p>
<p>A subscriber identity module or subscriber identification module (SIM),
widely known as a SIM card, is an integrated circuit that is intended to
securely store the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI)
number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate
subscribers on mobile telephony devices (such as mobile phones and
computers). It is also possible to store contact information on many SIM
cards. SIM cards are always used on GSM phones; for CDMA phones, they
are only needed for newer LTE-capable handsets. SIM cards can also be
used in satellite phones, smart watches, computers, or cameras.</p>
<p>The SIM circuit is part of the function of a universal integrated
circuit card (UICC) physical smart card, which is usually made of PVC
with embedded contacts and semiconductors. SIM cards are transferable
between different mobile devices. The first UICC smart cards were the
size of credit and bank cards; sizes were reduced several times over the
years, usually keeping electrical contacts the same, so that a larger
card could be cut down to a smaller size.</p>
<p>A SIM card contains its unique serial number (ICCID), international
mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, security authentication and
ciphering information, temporary information related to the local
network, a list of the services the user has access to, and two
passwords: a personal identification number (PIN) for ordinary use, and
a personal unblocking code (PUC) for PIN unlocking.</p>
<p>SIM cards have been made smaller over the years; functionality is
independent of format. Full-size SIM were followed by mini-SIM,
micro-SIM, and nano-SIM. SIM cards are also made to embed in devices.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sip"><a class="header" href="#sip">SIP</a></h1>
<p>Session Initiation Protocol</p>
<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a communications protocol for
signaling and controlling multimedia communication sessions in
applications of Internet telephony for voice and video calls, in private
IP telephone systems, as well as in instant messaging over Internet
Protocol (IP) networks.</p>
<p>The protocol defines the specific format of messages exchanged and the
sequence of communications for cooperation of the participants. SIP is a
text-based protocol, incorporating many elements of the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP).[1] A call established with SIP may consist of multiple media
streams, but no separate streams are required for applications, such as
text messaging, that exchange data as payload in the SIP message.</p>
<p>SIP works in conjunction with several other protocols that specify and
carry the session media. Media type and parameter negotiation and media
setup is performed with the Session Description Protocol (SDP), which is
carried as payload in SIP messages. SIP is designed to be independent of
the underlying transport layer protocol, and can be used with the User
Datagram Protocol (UDP), the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and
the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). For the transmission of
media streams (voice, video) SIP typically employs the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) or the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
(SRTP). For secure transmissions of SIP messages over insecure network
links, the protocol may be encrypted with Transport Layer Security
(TLS)<br />

location is the same for all processors; that is, it has uniform access
costs when the access actually is to memory. If the location is cached,
the access will be faster. but cache access times and memory access
times are the same on all processors.&quot;</p>
<p>SMP systems are tightly coupled multiprocessor systems with a pool of
homogeneous processors running independently of each other. Each
processor, executing different programs and working on different sets of
data, has the capability of sharing common resources (memory, I/O
device, interrupt system and so on) that are connected using a system
bus or a crossbar.</p>

<p>Simple Network Management Protocol</p>
<p>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard
protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices
on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device
behavior. Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems,
routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and more.</p>
<p>SNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring. SNMP
exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems
organized in a management information base (MIB) which describe the
system status and configuration. These variables can then be remotely
queried (and, in some circumstances, manipulated) by managing
applications.</p>
<p>Three significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed.
SNMPv1 is the original version of the protocol. More recent versions,
SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, feature improvements in performance, flexibility and
security.</p>
<p>SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of
standards for network management, including an application layer
protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.</p>

<p>Service-oriented architecture</p>
<p>Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where
services are provided to the other components by application components,
through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of
service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and
technologies. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be
accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as
retrieving a credit card statement online.</p>
<p>A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of
SOA:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It logically represents a business activity with a specified
outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is self-contained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a black box for its consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may consist of other underlying services.</p>
<p>Different services can be used in conjunction to provide the
functionality of a large software application, a principle SOA
shares with modular programming. Service-oriented architecture
integrates distributed, separately-maintained and -deployed software
components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that
facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network,
especially over an IP network.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="soap"><a class="header" href="#soap">SOAP</a></h1>
<p>Simple Object Access Protocol</p>
<p>SOAP (originally Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol
specification for exchanging structured information in the
implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to
induce extensibility, neutrality and independence. It uses XML
Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer
protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.</p>
<p>SOAP allows processes running on disparate operating systems (such as
Windows and Linux) to communicate using Extensible Markup Language
(XML). Since Web protocols like HTTP are installed and running on all
operating systems, SOAP allows clients to invoke web services and
receive responses independent of language and platforms.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sonet"><a class="header" href="#sonet">SONET</a></h1>
<p>Synchronous Optical Network</p>
<p>Synchronous optical networking (SONET) and synchronous digital hierarchy
(SDH) are standardized protocols that transfer multiple digital bit
streams synchronously over optical fiber using lasers or highly coherent
light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs). At low transmission rates data
can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The method was
developed to replace the plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) system
for transporting large amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over
the same fiber without synchronization problems.</p>
<p>SONET and SDH, which are essentially the same, were originally designed
to transport circuit mode communications (e.g., DS1, DS3) from a variety
of different sources, but they were primarily designed to support
real-time, uncompressed, circuit-switched voice encoded in PCM
format.[1] The primary difficulty in doing this prior to SONET/SDH was
that the synchronization sources of these various circuits were
different. This meant that each circuit was actually operating at a
slightly different rate and with different phase. SONET/SDH allowed for
the simultaneous transport of many different circuits of differing
origin within a single framing protocol. SONET/SDH is not a
communications protocol in itself, but a transport protocol.</p>
<p>Due to SONET/SDH's essential protocol neutrality and transport-oriented
features, SONET/SDH was the obvious choice for transporting the fixed
length Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames also known as cells. It
quickly evolved mapping structures and concatenated payload containers
to transport ATM connections. In other words, for ATM (and eventually
other protocols such as Ethernet), the internal complex structure
previously used to transport circuit-oriented connections was removed
and replaced with a large and concatenated frame (such as STS-3c) into
which ATM cells, IP packets, or Ethernet frames are placed.</p>

speech coding algorithm. Speex claims to be free of any patent
restrictions and is licensed under the revised (3-clause) BSD license.
It may be used with the Ogg container format or directly transmitted
over UDP/RTP. It may also be used with the FLV container format.</p>
<p>The Speex designers see their project as complementary to the Vorbis
general-purpose audio compression project.</p>
<p>Speex is a lossy format, i.e. quality is permanently degraded to reduce
file size.</p>
<p>The Speex project was created on February 13, 2002. The first
development versions of Speex were released under LGPL license, but as
of version 1.0 beta 1, Speex is released under Xiph's version of the

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sql"><a class="header" href="#sql">SQL</a></h1>
<p>SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and
designed for managing data held in a relational database management
system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream
management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling
structured data where there are relations between different
entities/variables of the data. SQL offers two main advantages over
older read/write APIs like ISAM or VSAM: first, it introduced the
concept of accessing many records with one single command; and second,
it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or
without an index.</p>
<p>Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus,
SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally
classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data
definition language (DDL), a data control language (DCL), and a data
manipulation language (DML). The scope of SQL includes data query, data
manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema
creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is
often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language
(4GL), it also includes procedural elements.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ss7"><a class="header" href="#ss7">SS7</a></h1>
<p>Signaling System 7</p>
<p>Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) is a set of telephony signaling protocols
developed in 1975, which is used to set up and tear down most of the
world's public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone calls. It
also performs number translation, local number portability, prepaid
billing, Short Message Service (SMS), and other mass market services.</p>
<p>In North America it is often referred to as CCSS7, abbreviated for
Common Channel Signaling System 7. In the United Kingdom, it is called
C7 (CCITT number 7), number 7 and CCIS7 (Common Channel Interoffice
Signaling 7). In Germany, it is often called ZZK-7 (Zentraler
ZeichengabeKanal Nummer 7).</p>
<p>The only international SS7 protocol is defined by ITU-T's Q.700-series
recommendations in 1988.[1] Of the many national variants of the SS7
protocols, most are based on variants of the international protocol as
standardized by ANSI and ETSI. National variants with striking
characteristics are the Chinese and Japanese (TTC) national variants.</p>
<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined the SIGTRAN
protocol suite that impinaplements levels 2, 3, and 4 protocols
compatible with SS7. Sometimes also called Pseudo SS7, it is layered on
the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) transport mechanism.</p>
<p>SS7 protocol suite</p>
<p>The SS7 protocol stack may be partially mapped to the OSI Model of a
packetized digital protocol stack. OSI layers 1 to 3 are provided by the
Message Transfer Part (MTP) and the Signalling Connection Control Part
(SCCP) of the SS7 protocol (together referred to as the Network Service
Part (NSP)); for circuit related signaling, such as the BT IUP,
Telephone User Part (TUP), or the ISDN User Part (ISUP), the User Part
provides layer 7. Currently there are no protocol components that
provide OSI layers 4 through 6.[1] The Transaction Capabilities
Application Part (TCAP) is the primary SCCP User in the Core Network,
using SCCP in connectionless mode. SCCP in connection oriented mode
provides transport layer for air interface protocols such as BSSAP and
RANAP. TCAP provides transaction capabilities to its Users (TC-Users),
such as the Mobile Application Part, the Intelligent Network Application
Part and the CAMEL Application Part.[citation needed]</p>
<p><img src="Glossary/s/./images/15009026.png?width=480" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Message Transfer Part (MTP) covers a portion of the functions of the
OSI network layer including: network interface, information transfer,
message handling and routing to the higher levels. Signaling Connection
Control Part (SCCP) is at functional Level 4. Together with MTP Level 3
it is called the Network Service Part (NSP). SCCP completes the
functions of the OSI network layer: end-to-end addressing and routing,
connectionless messages (UDTs), and management services for users of the
Network Service Part (NSP).[12] Telephone User Part (TUP) is a
link-by-link signaling system used to connect calls. ISUP is the key
user part, providing a circuit-based protocol to establish, maintain,
and end the connections for calls. Transaction Capabilities Application
Part (TCAP) is used to create database queries and invoke advanced
network functionality, or links to Intelligent Network Application Part
(INAP) for intelligent networks, or Mobile Application Part (MAP) for
mobile services.</p>

<p>Spanning Tree Protocol</p>
<p>The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a
loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks. The basic function of
STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results
from them. Spanning tree also allows a network design to include backup
links to provide fault tolerance if an active link fails.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, STP creates a spanning tree within a network of
connected layer-2 bridges, and disables those links that are not part of
the spanning tree, leaving a single active path between any two network
nodes. STP is based on an algorithm that was invented by Radia Perlman
while she was working for Digital Equipment Corporation.</p>
<p>In 2001, the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) as
802.1w. RSTP provides significantly faster recovery in response to
network changes or failures, introducing new convergence behaviors and
bridge port roles to do this. RSTP was designed to be
backwards-compatible with standard STP.</p>

<p>(STUN) is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol,
for traversal of network address translator (NAT) gateways in
applications of real-time voice, video, messaging, and other interactive
communications.</p>
<p>STUN is a tool used by other protocols, such as Interactive Connectivity
Establishment (ICE), the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), or WebRTC.
It provides a tool for hosts to discover the presence of a network
address translator, and to discover the mapped, usually public, Internet
Protocol (IP) address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the
application's User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. The
protocol requires assistance from a third-party network server (STUN
server) located on the opposing (public) side of the NAT, usually the
public Internet.</p>
<p>Originally, STUN was an acronym for Simple Traversal of User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) through Network Address Translators, but this title was
changed in a specification of an updated set of methods published as RFC
5389, retaining the same acronym</p>

address criticisms of Java.</p>
<p>Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that
the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Scala
provides language interoperability with Java, so that libraries written
in both languages may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like
Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax
reminiscent of the C programming language. Unlike Java, Scala has many
features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML
and Haskell, including currying, type inference, immutability, lazy
evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system
supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance,
higher-order types (but not higher-rank types), and anonymous types.
Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator
overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, and raw strings.
Conversely, a feature of Java not in Scala is checked exceptions, which

<p>General term for a plan that defines calendar timing, resources,

project or part of a project. CxOne defines two major classes of
schedules, <em>business schedules</em> and <em>detailed schedules</em>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="scheduler"><a class="header" href="#scheduler">Scheduler</a></h1>
<p>In computing, scheduling is the method by which work specified by some
means is assigned to resources that complete the work. The work may be
virtual computation elements such as threads, processes or data flows,
which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as processors,
network links or expansion cards.</p>
<p>A scheduler is what carries out the scheduling activity. Schedulers are
often implemented so they keep all computer resources busy (as in load
balancing), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively,
or to achieve a target quality of service. Scheduling is fundamental to
computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the execution model of a
computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have
computer multitasking with a single central processing unit (CPU).</p>
<p>A scheduler may aim at one or more of many goals, for example:
maximizing throughput (the total amount of work completed per time
unit); minimizing wait time (time from work becoming enabled until the
first point it begins execution on resources); minimizing latency or
response time (time from work becoming enabled until it is finished in
case of batch activity, or until the system responds and hands the first
output to the user in case of interactive activity); or maximizing
fairness (equal CPU time to each process, or more generally appropriate
times according to the priority and workload of each process). In
practice, these goals often conflict (e.g. throughput versus latency),
thus a scheduler will implement a suitable compromise. Preference is
measured by any one of the concerns mentioned above, depending upon the
user's needs and objectives.</p>
<p>In real-time environments, such as embedded systems for automatic
control in industry (for example robotics), the scheduler also must
ensure that processes can meet deadlines; this is crucial for keeping
the system stable. Scheduled tasks can also be distributed to remote
devices across a network and managed through an administrative back end.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="semaphore"><a class="header" href="#semaphore">Semaphore</a></h1>
<p>In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type
used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a
concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. Semaphore is
simply a variable. This variable is used to solve critical section
problems and to achieve process synchronization in the multi processing
environment.</p>
<p>A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example,
incremented or decremented, or toggled) depending on programmer-defined
conditions.</p>
<p>A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in the real-world systems
is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available,
coupled with operations to adjust that record safely (i.e. to avoid race
conditions) as units are required or become free, and, if necessary,
wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.</p>
<p>Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions;
however, their use is by no means a guarantee that a program is free
from these problems. Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count
are called counting semaphores, while semaphores which are restricted to
the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are
called binary semaphores and are used to implement locks.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="softswitch"><a class="header" href="#softswitch">Softswitch</a></h1>
<p>A softswitch (software switch) is a central device in a
telecommunications network which connects telephone calls from one phone
line to another, across a telecommunication network or the public
Internet, entirely by means of software running on a general-purpose
computer system. Most landline calls are routed by purpose-built
electronic hardware; however, soft switches using general purpose
servers and VoIP technology are becoming more popular.[1]</p>
<p>Many telecommunications networks now make use of combinations of
softswitches and more traditional purpose-built hardware.</p>
<p>Although the term softswitch technically refers to any such device, it
is more conventionally applied to a device that handles IP-to-IP phone
calls, while the phrase &quot;access server&quot; or &quot;media gateway&quot; is used to
refer to devices that either originate or terminate traditional &quot;land
line&quot; (hard wired) phone calls. In practice, such devices can often do
both. As a practical distinction, a Skype-to-Skype phone call is
entirely IP (internet) based, and so uses a softswitch somewhere in the
middle connecting the calling party with the called party. In contrast,
access servers might take a mobile call or a call originating from a
traditional phone line, convert it to IP traffic, then send it over the
internet to another such device, which terminates the call by reversing
the process and converting the Voice over IP call back to older circuit
switched digital systems using traditional digital ISDN / PSTN protocols
that transmit voice traffic using non-IP systems.</p>
<p>The Call Agent takes care of functions such as billing, call routing,
signaling, call services and the like, supplying the functional logic to
accomplish these telephony meta-tasks. A call agent may control several
different media gateways in geographically dispersed areas via a TCP/IP
link. It is also used to control the functions of media gateway, in
order to connect with media as well as other interfaces. This procedure
is utilized to keep the interfaces clear as crystal for receiving calls
from any phone lines.[2]</p>
<p>The softswitch generally resides in a building owned by the telephone
company called a telephone exchange (UK/IRL/AUS/NZ) or central office
(US/CAN). The central office or telephone exchange has high capacity
connections to carry calls to other offices owned by the
telecommunication company and to other telecommunication companies via
the PSTN.</p>
<p>Looking towards the end users from the switch, the softswitch may be
connected to several access devices via TCP/IP network. These access
devices can range from small and large Analog Telephone Adaptors (ATA)
which provide from one to hundreds of Telephone Pairs to an Integrated
Access Device (IAD), eMTA s (embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapters)
using MGCP/NCS protocol over cable (VoCable) or PBX which may provide
several hundred telephone connections</p>
<p>Note here that Analogue (ATA), PSTN telephone devices can only be
reached by a softswitch that has embedded SS7 or SIGTRAN cards, software
in terms of signalling AND Trunking Gateway for Voice traffic IP/TDM,
TDM/IP, TDM/TDM functions.</p>
<p>Typically the larger access devices will be located in a building owned
by the telecommunication company near to the customers they serve. Each
end user can be connected to the IAD by a simple pair of copper wires.</p>
<p>The medium-sized devices and PBXs are most commonly used by business
that locate them on their own premises, and single-line devices are
mostly found at private residences.</p>
<p>At the turn of the 21st century with IP Multimedia Subsystem (or IMS),
the Softswitch element is represented by the Media Gateway Controller
(MGC) element, and the term &quot;Softswitch&quot; is rarely used in the IMS
context. Rather, it is called an AGCF (Access Gateway Control Function).</p>

<p>In computing, source code is any collection of code, possibly with
comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually
as plain text. The source code of a program is specially designed to
facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to
be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source
code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary
machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be
stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be
interpreted and thus immediately executed.</p>
<p>Most application software is distributed in a form that includes only
executable files. If the source code were included it would be useful to
a user, programmer or a system administrator, any of whom might wish to
study or modify the program.</p>

<p>Individual protocols within a suite are often designed with a single
purpose in mind. This modularization makes design and evaluation easier.
Because each protocol module usually communicates with two others, they
are commonly imagined as layers in a stack of protocols. The lowest
protocol always deals with low-level interaction with the communications
hardware. Every higher layer adds more features and capability. User
applications usually deal only with the topmost layers (see also OSI

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="switch"><a class="header" href="#switch">Switch</a></h1>
<p>A network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, officially
MAC bridge) is a computer networking device that connects devices
together on a computer network by using packet switching to receive,
process, and forward data to the destination device.</p>
<p>A network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses hardware
addresses to process and forward data at the data link layer (layer 2)
of the OSI model. Some switches can also process data at the network
layer (layer 3) by additionally incorporating routing functionality.
Such switches are commonly known as layer-3 switches or multilayer
switches.</p>
<p>Switches for Ethernet are the most common form of network switch. The
first Ethernet switch was introduced by Kalpana in 1990. Switches also
exist for other types of networks including Fibre Channel, Asynchronous
Transfer Mode, and InfiniBand.</p>
<p>Unlike less advanced repeater hubs, which broadcast the same data out of
each of its ports and let the devices decide what data they need, a
network switch forwards data only to the devices that need to receive it</p>

<p>System X was developed by the UK Post Office (later to become British
Telecom), GEC, Plessey (later to be Marconi), and Standard Telephones
and Cables (STC).</p>
<p>System X covers three main types of telephone switching equipment. Many
of these switches reside all over the United Kingdom. Concentrators are
usually kept in local telephone exchanges but can be housed remotely in
less populated areas. DLEs and DMSUs operate in major towns and cities
and provide call routing functions.</p>
<p>Concentrator unit<br />
The concentrator unit consists of four main sub-systems, line modules,
digital concentrator switch, digital line termination (DLT) units and
control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to
digital format and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to
the digital local exchange (DLE). It also receives dialled information
from the subscriber and passes this to the DLE, so that the call can be
routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch
signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if
the connection to the DLE is lost.</p>
<p>Digital local exchange<br />
The Digital Local Exchange (DLE) connects to the concentrator and routes
calls to different DLEs or DMSUs depending on the destination of the
call. The heart of the DLE is the Digital Subscriber Switching Subsystem
(DSSS) which consists of Time Switches and a Space Switch. Incoming
traffic on the 30 channel PCM highways from the Concentrator Units is
connected to Time Switches. The purpose of these is to take any incoming
individual Time Slot and connect it to an outgoing Time Slot and so
perform a switching and routing function.</p>
<p>Digital main switching unit<br />
The Digital Main Switching Unit (DMSU) deals with calls that have been
routed by DLEs or another DMSU and is a 'trunk switch', i.e. it is not
connected to any concentrators. As with DLEs, DMSUs are made up of a
Digital Switching Subsystem and a Processor Utility Subsystem, amongst
other things. In the British PSTN network, each DMSU is connected to
every other DMSU in the country, enabling almost congestion-proof
connectivity for calls through the network.</p>
<p>Replacement system<br />
Many of the switches installed during the 1980s are near to or over 30
years old and still in use within local exchanges, giving an idea of
their reliability.</p>
<p>System X was scheduled for replacement with Next Generation softswitch
equipment as part of the BT 21st Century Network (21CN) programme. Some
other users of System X -- in particular Jersey Telecom and Kingston
Communications -- replaced their circuit switched System X equipment
with Marconi XCD5000 softswitches (which are the NGN replacement for
System X) and Access Hub multiservice access nodes. However, the
omission of Marconi from the BT 21CN supplier list, the lack of a
suitable replacement softswitch to match System X reliability, and the
shift in focus away from telephony onto broadband -- all led to much of
the System X estate being maintained.</p>

<p>Transaction Capabilities Application Part</p>
<p>Transaction Capabilities Application Part, from ITU-T recommendations
Q.771-Q.775 or ANSI T1.114 is a protocol for Signalling System 7
networks. Its primary purpose is to facilitate multiple concurrent
dialogs between the same sub-systems on the same machines, using
Transaction IDs to differentiate these, similar to the way TCP ports
facilitate multiplexing connections between the same IP addresses on the
Internet.</p>
<p>TCAP uses ASN.1 BER encoding, as well as the protocols it encapsulates,

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tcp"><a class="header" href="#tcp">TCP</a></h1>
<p>Transmission Control Protocol</p>
<p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of
the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network
implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP).
Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP
provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of
octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via
an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web,
email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP.
Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use
the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless
datagram service that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability.</p>

<p>Time Division Multiplexing</p>
<p>Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is a method of transmitting and
receiving independent signals over a common signal path by means of
synchronized switches at each end of the transmission line so that each
signal appears on the line only a fraction of time in an alternating
pattern. It is used when the bit rate of the transmission medium exceeds
that of the signal to be transmitted. This form of signal multiplexing
was developed in telecommunications for telegraphy systems in the late
19th century, but found its most common application in digital telephony
in the second half of the 20th century.<br />

<p>Temporal Key Integrity Protocol</p>
<p>Temporal Key Integrity Protocol or TKIP /tiːˈkɪp/ is a security protocol
used in the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard. TKIP was designed
by the IEEE 802.11i task group and the Wi-Fi Alliance as an interim
solution to replace WEP without requiring the replacement of legacy
hardware. This was necessary because the breaking of WEP had left Wi-Fi
networks without viable link-layer security, and a solution was required
for already deployed hardware. However, TKIP itself is no longer
considered secure, and was deprecated in the 2012 revision of the 802.11
standard.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tls"><a class="header" href="#tls">TLS</a></h1>
<p>Transport Layer Security</p>
<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) -- and its predecessor, Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL), which is now deprecated by the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) -- are cryptographic protocols that provide communications
security over a computer network. Several versions of the protocols find
widespread use in applications such as web browsing, email, instant
messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). Websites are able to use TLS to
secure all communications between their servers and web browsers.</p>
<p>The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity
between two or more communicating computer applications. When secured by
TLS, connections between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server
(e.g., wikipedia.org) have one or more of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The connection is private (or secure) because symmetric cryptography
is used to encrypt the data transmitted. The keys for this symmetric
encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based
on a shared secret negotiated at the start of the session. The
server and client negotiate the details of which encryption
algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of
data is transmitted . The negotiation of a shared secret is both
secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and
cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the
middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the
communications during the negotiation without being detected).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using
public-key cryptography. This authentication can be made optional,
but is generally required for at least one of the parties (typically
the server).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The connection is reliable because each message transmitted includes
a message integrity check using a message authentication code to
prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during
transmission.</p>

<p>Tk is a free and open-source, cross-platform widget toolkit that
provides a library of basic elements of GUI widgets for building a
graphical user interface (GUI) in many programming languages.</p>
<p>Tk provides a number of widgets commonly needed to develop desktop
applications, such as button, menu, canvas, text, frame, label, etc. Tk
has been ported to run on most flavors of Linux, Mac OS, Unix, and
Microsoft Windows. Like Tcl, Tk supports Unicode within the Basic
Multilingual Plane but it has not yet been extended to handle 32-bit
Unicode.</p>
<p>Tk was designed to be extended, and a wide range of extensions are
available that offer new widgets or other capabilities.</p>
<p>Since Tcl/Tk 8, it offers &quot;native look and feel&quot; (for instance, menus
and buttons are displayed in the manner of &quot;native&quot; software for any
given platform). Highlights of version 8.5 include a new theming engine,
originally called Tk Tile, but now generally referred to as &quot;themed Tk&quot;,
as well as improved font rendering.</p>

<p>tcsh is a Unix shell based on and compatible with the C shell (csh). It

shells, functions cannot be defined in a tcsh script and the user must
use aliases instead (as in csh). It is the native root
shell for BSD-based systems such as FreeBSD.</p>
<p>tcsh added filename and command completion and command line editing
concepts borrowed from the Tenex system, which is the source of the &quot;t&quot;.
Because it only added functionality and did not change what was there,
tcsh remained backward compatible with the original C shell. Though it
started as a side branch from the original source tree Joy had created,
tcsh is now the main branch for ongoing development. tcsh is very stable
but new releases continue to appear roughly once a year, consisting
mostly of minor bug fixes.</p>

<p>Technical debt can be compared to monetary debt. If technical debt is
not repaid, it can accumulate 'interest', making it harder to implement
changes later on. Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy.
Technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes (e.g., as a
proof-of-concept) technical debt is required to move projects forward.
On the other hand, some experts claim that the &quot;technical debt&quot; metaphor
tends to minimize the impact, which results in insufficient

<p>User Agent</p>
<p>In computing, a user agent is software (a software agent) that is acting
on behalf of a user. One common use of the term refers to a web browser
telling a website information about the browser and operating system.
This allows the website to customize content for the capabilities of a
particular device, but also raises privacy issues.</p>
<p>There are other uses of the term &quot;user agent&quot;. For example, an email
reader is a mail user agent. In many cases, a user agent acts as a
client in a network protocol used in communications within a
client--server distributed computing system. In particular, the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) identifies the client software
originating the request, using a user-agent header, even when the client
is not operated by a user. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
protocol (based on HTTP) followed this usage. In the SIP, the term user
agent refers to both end points of a communications session.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="udp"><a class="header" href="#udp">UDP</a></h1>
<p>User Datagram Protocol</p>
<p>In computer networking, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the
core members of the Internet protocol suite. The protocol was designed
by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768. With UDP,
computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as
datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Prior
communications are not required in order to set up communication
channels or data paths.</p>
<p>UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of
protocol mechanism. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port
numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination
of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the
user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; There is
no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If
error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level,
an application may use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this
purpose.</p>
<p>UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are
either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the
overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive
applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to
waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an
option in a real-time system.<br />

<p>The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to
standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software
design. It was developed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson and James
Rumbaugh at Rational Software in 1994--1995, with further development

<p>In 1997 UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group
(OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005 UML
was also published by the International Organization for Standardization

<p>Design<br />
UML offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a
diagram, including elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>any activities (jobs);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>individual components of the system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and how they can interact with other software components;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how the system will run;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how entities interact with others (components and interfaces);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>external user interface.</p>
<p>Although originally intended for object-oriented design
documentation, UML has been extended to a larger set of design
documentation (as listed above),and been found useful in many
contexts.</p>

<p>Universal Mobile Telecommunications System</p>
<p>The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a third
generation mobile cellular system for networks based on the GSM
standard. Developed and maintained by the 3GPP (3rd Generation
Partnership Project), UMTS is a component of the International
Telecommunications Union IMT-2000 standard set and compares with the
CDMA2000 standard set for networks based on the competing cdmaOne
technology. UMTS uses wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA)
radio access technology to offer greater spectral efficiency and
bandwidth to mobile network operators.</p>
<p>UMTS specifies a complete network system, which includes the radio
access network (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network, or UTRAN), the
core network (Mobile Application Part, or MAP) and the authentication of
users via SIM (subscriber identity module) cards.</p>
<p>The technology described in UMTS is sometimes also referred to as
Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access (FOMA) or 3GSM.</p>

<p>Uniform Resource Identifier</p>
<p>URIs encompasses both URLs, URNs, and other ways to indicate a resource.</p>
<p>An example of a URI that is neither a URL nor a URN would be a data URI
such as data:,Hello%20World. It is not a URL or URN because the URI
contains the data. It neither names it, nor tells you how to locate it
over the network.</p>
<p>There are also uniform resource citations (URCs) that point to meta data
about a document rather than to the document itself. An example of a URC
would be an indicator for viewing the source code of a web page:
view-source:</p>
<p><a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a></p>
<p>. A URC is another type of URI that is neither URL nor URN.</p>

<p>Coordinated Universal Time</p>
<p>Coordinated Universal Time or Universal Time Coordinated (abbreviated to
UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks
and time. It is within about 1 second of mean solar time at 0°
longitude, and does not observe daylight saving time. For most purposes,
UTC is considered interchangeable with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but
GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="utf-16"><a class="header" href="#utf-16">UTF-16</a></h1>
<p>UTF-32 stands for Unicode Transformation Format in 32 bits. It is a
protocol to encode Unicode code points that uses exactly 32 bits per
Unicode code point (but a number of leading bits must be zero as there
are fewer than 221 Unicode code points). UTF-32 is a fixed-length
encoding, in contrast to all other Unicode transformation formats, which
are variable-length encodings. Each 32-bit value in UTF-32 represents
one Unicode code point and is exactly equal to that code point's
numerical value.</p>
<p>The main advantage of UTF-32 is that the Unicode code points are
directly indexed. Finding the Nth code point in a sequence of code
points is a constant time operation. In contrast, a variable-length code
requires sequential access to find the Nth code point in a sequence.
This makes UTF-32 a simple replacement in code that uses integers that
are incremented by one to examine each location in a string, as was
commonly done for ASCII.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of UTF-32 is that it is space-inefficient, using
four bytes per code point. Characters beyond the BMP are relatively rare
in most texts, and can typically be ignored for sizing estimates. This
makes UTF-32 close to twice the size of UTF-16. It can be up to four
times the size of UTF-8 depending on how many of the characters are in
the ASCII subset.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="utf-8"><a class="header" href="#utf-8">UTF-8</a></h1>
<p>UTF-8 is a variable width character encoding capable of encoding all
1,112,064 valid code points in Unicode using one to four 8-bit bytes.
The encoding is defined by the Unicode standard, and was originally
designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. The name is derived from Unicode
(or Universal Coded Character Set) Transformation Format -- 8-bit.</p>
<p>It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII. Code points with
lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded
using fewer bytes. The first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond
one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single octet with the same
binary value as ASCII, so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8-encoded
Unicode as well. Since ASCII bytes do not occur when encoding non-ASCII
code points into UTF-8, UTF-8 is safe to use within most programming and
document languages that interpret certain ASCII characters in a special
way, such as &quot;/&quot; in filenames, &quot;&quot; in escape sequences, and&quot;%&quot; in
printf.</p>
<p>UTF-8 has been the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web
since 2009, as it is most popular in every country, and as of July 2018
accounts for 91.9% of all web pages and 95.5% of the top 1,000 highest
ranked web pages (some of which are simply ASCII, a subset of UTF-8).
The next-most popular multibyte encodings, Shift JIS and GB 2312, have
0.5% and 0.5% respectively. The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC)
recommended that all e-mail programs be able to display and create mail
using UTF-8,and the W3C recommends UTF-8 as the default encoding in XML
and HTML.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="utran"><a class="header" href="#utran">UTRAN</a></h1>
<p>Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network</p>
<p>UTRAN (short for &quot;Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network&quot;) is a
collective term for the network and equipment that connects mobile
handsets to the public telephone network or the Internet. It contains
the base stations, which are called Node B's and Radio Network
Controllers (RNCs) which make up the UMTS radio access network. This
communications network, commonly referred to as 3G (for 3rd Generation
Wireless Mobile Communication Technology), can carry many traffic types
from real-time Circuit Switched to IP based Packet Switched. The UTRAN
allows connectivity between the UE (user equipment) and the core
network.</p>
<p>The RNC provides control functionalities for one or more Node Bs. A Node
B and an RNC can be the same device, although typical implementations
have a separate RNC located in a central office serving multiple Node
Bs. Despite the fact that they do not have to be physically separated,
there is a logical interface between them known as the Iub. The RNC and
its corresponding Node Bs are called the Radio Network Subsystem (RNS).
There can be more than one RNS present in a UTRAN.</p>
<p>There are four interfaces connecting the UTRAN internally or externally
to other functional entities: Iu, Uu, Iub and Iur. The Iu interface is
an external interface that connects the RNC to the Core Network (CN).
The Uu is also external, connecting the Node B with the User Equipment
(UE). The Iub is an internal interface connecting the RNC with the Node
B. And at last there is the Iur interface which is an internal interface
most of the time, but can, exceptionally be an external interface too
for some network architectures. The Iur connects two RNCs with each
other.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="unicode"><a class="header" href="#unicode">Unicode</a></h1>
<p>Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding,
representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's
writing systems. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium,
and as of June 2018 the most recent version, Unicode 11.0, contains a
repertoire of 137,439 characters covering 146 modern and historic
scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets and emoji. The character
repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646,
and both are code-for-code identical.</p>
<p>The Unicode Standard consists of a set of code charts for visual
reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a
set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as
character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation,
rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of
text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew,
and left-to-right scripts).</p>
<p>Unicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread
and predominant use in the internationalization and localization of
computer software. The standard has been implemented in many recent
technologies, including modern operating systems, XML, Java (and other
programming languages), and the .NET Framework.</p>
<p>Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings. The Unicode
standard defines UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, and several other encodings
are in use. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and
UCS-2, a precursor of UTF-16.</p>
<p>UTF-8, dominantly used by websites (over 91%), uses one byte for the
first 128 code points, and up to 4 bytes for other characters. The first
128 Unicode code points are the ASCII characters, which means that any
ASCII text is also a UTF-8 text.</p>
<p>UCS-2 uses two bytes (16 bits) for each character but can only encode
the first 65,536 code points, the so-called Basic Multilingual Plane
(BMP). With 1,114,112 code points on 17 planes being possible, and with
over 137,000 code points defined so far, many Unicode characters are
beyond the reach of UCS-2. Therefore, UCS-2 is obsolete, though still
widely used in software. UTF-16 extends UCS-2, by using the same 16-bit
encoding as UCS-2 for the Basic Multilingual Plane, and a 4-byte
encoding for the other planes. As long as it contains no code points in
the reserved range U+D800--U+DFFF, a UCS-2 text is a valid UTF-16 text.</p>
<p>UTF-32 (also referred to as UCS-4) uses four bytes for each character.
Like UCS-2, the number of bytes per character is fixed, facilitating
character indexing; but unlike UCS-2, UTF-32 is able to encode all
Unicode code points. However, because each character uses four bytes,
UTF-32 takes significantly more space than other encodings, and is not
widely used.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="unified-communications"><a class="header" href="#unified-communications">Unified Communications</a></h1>
<p>Unified communications (UC) is a business and marketing concept
describing the integration of enterprise communication services such as
instant messaging (chat), presence information, voice (including IP
telephony), mobility features (including extension mobility and single
number reach), audio, web &amp; video conferencing, fixed-mobile convergence
(FMC), desktop sharing, data sharing (including web connected electronic
interactive whiteboards), call control and speech recognition with
non-real-time communication services such as unified messaging
(integrated voicemail, e-mail, SMS and fax). UC is not necessarily a
single product, but a set of products that provides a consistent unified
user interface and user experience across multiple devices and media
types.</p>
<p>In its broadest sense, the UC can encompass all forms of communications
that are exchanged via a network to include other forms of
communications such as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and digital
signage Communications as they become an integrated part of the network
communications deployment and may be directed as one-to-one
communications or broadcast communications from one to many.</p>
<p>UC allows an individual to send a message on one medium and receive the
same communication on another medium. For example, one can receive a
voicemail message and choose to access it through e-mail or a cell
phone. If the sender is online according to the presence information and
currently accepts calls, the response can be sent immediately through
text chat or a video call. Otherwise, it may be sent as a non-real-time
message that can be accessed through a variety of media.</p>

<p>Initially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&amp;T licensed Unix to
outside parties in the late 1970s, leading to a variety of both academic
and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of
California, Berkeley (BSD), Microsoft (Xenix), IBM (AIX), and Sun
Microsystems (Solaris). In the early 1990s, AT&amp;T sold its rights in Unix
to Novell, which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation
(SCO) in 1995. The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group, a neutral
industry consortium, which allows the use of the mark for certified
operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).
As of 2014, the Unix version with the largest installed base is Apple's
macOS.</p>

March 1998 and February 1999. It is also known as V.Last as it was
anticipated to be the last standard for modems operating near the
channel capacity of POTS lines to be developed. V.90 is generally used
in concert with the V.42bis compression standard. A follow-on standard,
V.92, was developed later in 1999 to replace V.90.</p>

<p>Voice Activity Detection</p>
<p>Voice activity detection (VAD), also known as speech activity detection
or speech detection, is a technique used in speech processing in which
the presence or absence of human speech is detected. The main uses of
VAD are in speech coding and speech recognition. It can facilitate
speech processing, and can also be used to deactivate some processes
during non-speech section of an audio session: it can avoid unnecessary
coding/transmission of silence packets in Voice over Internet Protocol
applications, saving on computation and on network bandwidth.</p>
<p>VAD is an important enabling technology for a variety of speech-based
applications. Therefore, various VAD algorithms have been developed that
provide varying features and compromises between latency, sensitivity,
accuracy and computational cost. Some VAD algorithms also provide
further analysis, for example whether the speech is voiced, unvoiced or
sustained. Voice activity detection is usually language independent.</p>

<p>Virtual Circuit</p>
<p>A virtual circuit (VC) is a means of transporting data over a packet
switched computer network in such a way that it appears as though there
is a dedicated physical layer link between the source and destination
end systems of this data. The term virtual circuit is synonymous with
virtual connection and virtual channel. Before a connection or virtual
circuit may be used, it has to be established, between two or more nodes
or software applications, by configuring the relevant parts of the
interconnecting network. After that, a bit stream or byte stream may be
delivered between the nodes; hence, a virtual circuit protocol allows
higher level protocols to avoid dealing with the division of data into
segments, packets, or frames.</p>
<p>Virtual circuit communication resembles circuit switching, since both
are connection oriented, meaning that in both cases data is delivered in
correct order, and signalling overhead is required during a connection
establishment phase. However, circuit switching provides a constant bit
rate and latency, while these may vary in a virtual circuit service due
to factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>varying packet queue lengths in the network nodes,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>varying bit rate generated by the application,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>varying load from other users sharing the same network resources by
means of statistical multiplexing, etc.</p>
<p>Many virtual circuit protocols, but not all, provide reliable
communication service through the use of data retransmissions
because of error detection and automatic repeat request (ARQ).</p>
<p>An alternate network configuration to virtual circuit is datagram.</p>

<p>Virtual Channel Identifier</p>
<p>The VCI, used in conjunction with the VPI (virtual path indicator),
indicates where an ATM cell is to travel over a network. ATM, or
asynchronous transfer mode, is a method that many ISPs (Internet Service
Providers) use to transfer data to client computers. Because ATM sends
packets over fixed channels, the data is easier to track than
information sent over the standard TCP/IP protocol.</p>
<p>The VCI within each ATM cell defines the fixed channel on which the
packet of information should be sent. It is a 16-bit field, compared to
the VPI, which is only 8 bits. Since this numerical tag specifies the
virtual channel that each packet belongs to, it prevents interference
with other data being sent across the network.</p>

<p>Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line</p>
<p>Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) and very-high-bit-rate
digital subscriber line 2 <a href="Glossary/v/2">VDSL2</a> are digital subscriber line (DSL)
technologies providing data transmission faster than asymmetric digital
subscriber line (ADSL).</p>
<p>VDSL offers speeds of up to 52 Mbit/s downstream and 16 Mbit/s upstream,
over a single flat untwisted or twisted pair of copper wires using the
frequency band from 25 kHz to 12 MHz. These rates mean that VDSL is
capable of supporting applications such as high-definition television,
as well as telephone services (voice over IP) and general Internet
access, over a single connection. VDSL is deployed over existing wiring
used for analog telephone service and lower-speed DSL connections. This
standard was approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
in November 2001.</p>
<p>Second-generation systems (VDSL2; ITU-T G.993.2 approved in February
2006) use frequencies of up to 30 MHz to provide data rates exceeding
100 Mbit/s simultaneously in both the upstream and downstream
directions. The maximum available bit rate is achieved at a range of
about 300 meters; performance degrades as the local loop attenuation
increases.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vhdl"><a class="header" href="#vhdl">VHDL</a></h1>
<p>The VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is a hardware description
language (HDL) that can model the behavior and structure of digital
systems at multiple levels of abstraction, ranging from the system level
down to that of logic gates, for design entry, documentation, and
verification purposes. Since 1987, VHDL has been standardized by the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as IEEE Std
1076; the latest version (as of April 2020) of which is IEEE Std
1076-2019. To model analog and mixed-signal systems, an
IEEE-standardized HDL based on VHDL called VHDL-AMS (officially IEEE
1076.1) has been developed.</p>
<p>VHDL is named after the United States Department of Defense program that
created it, the Very High-Speed Integrated Circuits Program (VHSIC). In
the early 1980s, the VHSIC Program sought a new HDL for use in the
design of the integrated circuits it aimed to develop. The product of
this effort was VHDL Version 7.2, released in 1985. The effort to
standardize it as an IEEE standard began in the following year.</p>
<p>VHDL is generally used to write text models that describe a logic
circuit. Such a model is processed by a synthesis program, only if it is
part of the logic design. A simulation program is used to test the logic
design using simulation models to represent the logic circuits that
interface to the design. This collection of simulation models is
commonly called a testbench.</p>
<p>A VHDL simulator is typically an event-driven simulator. This means that
each transaction is added to an event queue for a specific scheduled
time. E.g. if a signal assignment should occur after 1 nanosecond, the
event is added to the queue for time +1ns. Zero delay is also allowed,
but still needs to be scheduled: for these cases delta delay is used,
which represent an infinitely small time step. The simulation alters
between two modes: statement execution, where triggered statements are
evaluated, and event processing, where events in the queue are
processed.</p>
<p>VHDL has constructs to handle the parallelism inherent in hardware
designs, but these constructs (processes) differ in syntax from the
parallel constructs in Ada (tasks). Like Ada, VHDL is strongly typed and
is not case sensitive. In order to directly represent operations which
are common in hardware, there are many features of VHDL which are not
found in Ada, such as an extended set of Boolean operators including
nand and nor.</p>
<p>VHDL has file input and output capabilities, and can be used as a
general-purpose language for text processing, but files are more
commonly used by a simulation testbench for stimulus or verification
data. There are some VHDL compilers which build executable binaries. In
this case, it might be possible to use VHDL to write a testbench to
verify the functionality of the design using files on the host computer
to define stimuli, to interact with the user, and to compare results
with those expected. However, most designers leave this job to the
simulator.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy for an inexperienced developer to produce code
that simulates successfully but that cannot be synthesized into a real
device, or is too large to be practical. One particular pitfall is the
accidental production of transparent latches rather than D-type
flip-flops as storage elements.</p>
<p>One can design hardware in a VHDL IDE (for FPGA implementation such as
Xilinx ISE, Altera Quartus, Synopsys Synplify or Mentor Graphics HDL
Designer) to produce the RTL schematic of the desired circuit. After
that, the generated schematic can be verified using simulation software
which shows the waveforms of inputs and outputs of the circuit after
generating the appropriate testbench. To generate an appropriate
testbench for a particular circuit or VHDL code, the inputs have to be
defined correctly. For example, for clock input, a loop process or an
iterative statement is required.</p>
<p>A final point is that when a VHDL model is translated into the &quot;gates
and wires&quot; that are mapped onto a programmable logic device such as a
CPLD or FPGA, then it is the actual hardware being configured, rather
than the VHDL code being &quot;executed&quot; as if on some form of a processor
chip.</p>

<p>A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and
isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer

context virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by
additional logic. VLANs work by applying tags to network packets and
handling these tags in networking systems -- creating the appearance and
functionality of network traffic that is physically on a single network
but acts as if it is split between separate networks. In this way, VLANs
can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the
same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling
and networking devices to be deployed.</p>

<p>Visitor Location Register</p>
<p>The Visitor Location Register (VLR) is a database of the MSs (Mobile
stations) that have roamed into the jurisdiction of the MSC (Mobile
Switching Center) which it serves. Each main base station in the network
is served by exactly one VLR (one BTS may be served by many MSCs in case
of MSC in pool), hence a subscriber cannot be present in more than one
VLR at a time.</p>
<p>The data stored in the VLR has either been received from the Home
Location Register (HLR), or collected from the MS. In practice, for
performance reasons, most vendors integrate the VLR directly to the
V-MSC and, where this is not done, the VLR is very tightly linked with
the MSC via a proprietary interface. Whenever an MSC detects a new MS in
its network, in addition to creating a new record in the VLR, it also
updates the HLR of the mobile subscriber, apprising it of the new
location of that MS. If VLR data is corrupted it can lead to serious
issues with text messaging and call services.</p>

<p>Video On Demand</p>
<p>Video on demand is a programming system which allows users to select and
watch/listen to video or audio content such as movies and TV shows
whenever they choose, rather than at a scheduled broadcast time, the
method that prevailed with over-the-air programming during the 20th
century. IPTV technology is commonly used to bring VOD to televisions
and personal computers.</p>
<p>Television VOD systems can stream content through either a set-top box,
a computer or other device, allowing viewing in real time, or download
it to a device such as a computer, digital video recorder (also called a
personal video recorder) or portable media player for viewing at any
time. The majority of cable- and telephone company-based television
providers offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>VOD streaming, whereby a user selects a video program and it begins
to play immediately on the television set, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>downloading to a digital video recorder (DVR) rented or purchased
from the provider, or downloading onto a PC or to a portable device,
for viewing in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internet television, using the Internet, is an increasingly popular
form of video on demand. VOD can also be accessed via desktop client
applications such as the Apple iTunes online content store.</p>
<p>Some airlines offer VOD as in-flight entertainment to passengers
through individually controlled video screens embedded in seatback
or armrests or offered via portable media players. Some video on
demand services, such as Netflix, use a subscription model that
requires users to pay a monthly fee to access a bundled set of
content, which is mainly movies and TV shows. Other services use an
advertising-based model, where access is free.</p>

<p>Virtual Private LAN Service</p>
<p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a way to provide Ethernet-based
multipoint to multipoint communication over IP or MPLS networks. It
allows geographically dispersed sites to share an Ethernet broadcast
domain by connecting sites through pseudowires. The term 'sites'
includes multiplicities of both servers and clients. The technologies
that can be used as pseudo-wire can be Ethernet over MPLS, L2TPv3 or
even GRE. There are two IETF standards track RFCs (RFC 4761 and RFC
4762) describing VPLS establishment.</p>
<p>VPLS is a virtual private network (VPN) technology. In contrast to
L2TPv3, which allows only point-to-point layer 2 tunnels, VPLS allows
any-to-any (multipoint) connectivity.</p>
<p>In a VPLS, the local area network (LAN) at each site is extended to the
edge of the provider network. The provider network then emulates a
switch or bridge to connect all of the customer LANs to create a single
bridged LAN.</p>
<p>VPLS is designed for applications that require multipoint or broadcast
access.<br />

IoT devices and wearables. It is based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem
(IMS) network, with specific profiles for control and media planes of
voice service on LTE defined by GSMA in PRD IR.92. This approach results
in the voice service (control and media planes) being delivered as data
flows within the LTE data bearer. This means that there is no dependency
on (or ultimately, requirement for) the legacy circuit-switched voice
network to be maintained. VoLTE has up to three times more voice and
data capacity than 3G UMTS and up to six times more than 2G GSM.
Furthermore, it frees up bandwidth because VoLTE's packets headers are

Instead, each node participates in routing by forwarding data for other
nodes, so the determination of which nodes forward data is made
dynamically on the basis of network connectivity and the routing
algorithm in use.<br />
In the Windows operating system, ad-hoc is a communication mode
(setting) that allows computers to directly communicate with each other
without a router.<br />
Wireless mobile ad hoc networks are self-configuring, dynamic networks
in which nodes are free to move. Wireless networks lack the complexities

(APs). There are twenty of these dotted around the country, and these
are the same as the Core nodes discussed on the 21CN overview. One
aggregation point will cover a region of the country, so an ISP would
need to have presence at all twenty to cover the entire of the UK.<br />

<p>Wholesale Broadband Connect Converge</p>
<p>There is relatively little public information available about this
product. It is known to roll the voice and broadband products in to a
package, with BT providing the ISP a single bill for both. Given that
this product will again be based on WBC, one can only assume that the
same product options and QoS would also be available.</p>

<p>Wholesale Broadband Managed Connect</p>
<p>The IPSC replacement<br />
In the same way that the vanilla WBC product could be seen as a
replacement for DataStream, WBMC can be seen as a replacement for
IPStream. This product is an end-to-end product, encompassing the EUA
(End User Access), presence at the APs (Aggregation Points), EPs
(Extension Paths) and an MSIL (Although the MSIL is purchased separately
by the ISP). Ultimately this saves the ISP having to manage and maintain
presence at the 20 WBC nodes (APs), which would involve considerable
initial outlay and ongoing investment. The backhaul is also managed by
BT entirely. On the other side of the coin this means the ISP is locked
in to a BT platform - which may not necessarily be the cheapest - and it
certainly does not offer all of the flexibility that an ISP using WBC
would receive. That said, all of the same products and QoS options are
available on WBMC as on WBC.</p>

<p>Wired Equivalent Privacy</p>
<p>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security algorithm for IEEE 802.11
wireless networks. Introduced as part of the original 802.11 standard
ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide data confidentiality
comparable to that of a traditional wired network. WEP, recognizable by
its key of 10 or 26 hexadecimal digits (40 or 104 bits), was at one time
widely in use and was often the first security choice presented to users
by router configuration tools.</p>
<p>In 2003 the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP had been superseded by
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). In 2004, with the ratification of the full
802.11i standard (i.e. WPA2), the IEEE declared that both WEP-40 and
WEP-104 have been deprecated.</p>
<p>WEP was the only encryption protocol available to 802.11a and 802.11b
devices built before the WPA standard, which was available for 802.11g
devices.</p>

<p>Warfighter Information Network - Tactical</p>
<p>WIN-T is the U.S. Army's tactical network backbone, providing secure
voice and data communications for soldiers on the battlefield without
the need for fixed infrastructure. By connecting soldiers with their
commanders, WIN-T is changing the way the U.S. Army fights by providing
life-saving information on-the-move, anywhere in the world. WIN-T
enables soldiers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stream real-time video over the network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View a topographical map of friendly forces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send texts requesting medical assistance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digitally call for artillery support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access mission command apps like CPOF and TIGR</p>
<p>WIN-T INCREMENT 1: COMMUNICATIONS AT-THE-HALT<br />
Originally known as the Joint Network Node Network (JNN-N) program,
WIN-T Increment 1 (Inc. 1) began fielding in 2004 to support combat
missions during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi
Freedom.</p>
<p>With WIN-T Inc. 1, for the first time in history, the soldiers on
the battlefield had a high-speed, interoperable voice and data
communications network at the battalion level.</p>
<p>WIN-T INCREMENT 2: COMMUNICATIONS ON-THE-MOVE<br />
The Army's 10th Mountain Division was the first to field WIN-T
Inc. 2 new capabilities when they deployed for Afghanistan in
July 2013. WIN-T Inc. 2's unique value was immediately recognized,
as it provided soldiers with communications even as fixed
infrastructure was removed.</p>
<p>The Tactical Communication Nodes in Inc. 2 took the first step in
providing a mobile infrastructure on the battlefield. This includes
mobile Point Of Presence systems (installed on select vehicles at
battalion levels and above, which include four companies of up to
200 soldiers and about 10 to 30 vehicles each), vehicle wireless
packages, and the Soldier Network Extension (for Company-level
connectivity).</p>
<p>Increment 2 enables mission command from brigade to division to
company through a completely ad-hoc, self-forming network.
Commanders and select staff now have the ability to maneuver
anywhere on the battlefield and maintain connectivity to the
network, without the need to stop and set up communications, making
them vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>Wholesale line rental (WLR) is a service in which a telecommunications
operator takes control of all the connections made through a telephone
line from the native operator and collects the subscription fee from the
subscribers.</p>
<p>With WLR the alternative telecoms provider buys a wholesale product from
the incumbent (usually in conjunction with a wholesale call product such
as CPS) and is then able to produce a single bill for the end user
covering calls and line rental. Broadband services can also be provided
by the WLR operator (and included in a single bill) if a separate
wholesale DSL product is purchased from the incumbent, but this is
optional.</p>

<p>Windows Media Audio (WMA) is the name of a series of audio codecs and
their corresponding audio coding formats developed by Microsoft. It is a
proprietary technology that forms part of the Windows Media framework.
WMA consists of four distinct codecs. The original WMA codec, known
simply as WMA, was conceived as a competitor to the popular MP3 and
RealAudio codecs. WMA Pro, a newer and more advanced codec, supports
multichannel and high resolution audio. A lossless codec, WMA Lossless,
compresses audio data without loss of audio fidelity (the regular WMA
format is lossy).[3] WMA Voice, targeted at voice content, applies
compression using a range of low bit rates.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi Protected Access</p>
<p>Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) are
two security protocols and security certification programs developed by
the Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks. The Alliance
defined these in response to serious weaknesses researchers had found in
the previous system, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).</p>
<p>WPA (sometimes referred to as the draft IEEE 802.11i standard) became
available in 2003. The Wi-Fi Alliance intended it as an intermediate
measure in anticipation of the availability of the more secure and
complex WPA2, which became available in 2004 and is a common shorthand
for the full IEEE 802.11i (or IEEE 802.11i-2004) standard.</p>

<p>Created by the Wi-Fi Alliance and introduced in 2006, the goal of the
protocol is to allow home users who know little of wireless security and
may be intimidated by the available security options to set up Wi-Fi
Protected Access, as well as making it easy to add new devices to an
existing network without entering long passphrases. Prior to the
standard, several competing solutions were developed by different
vendors to address the same need.</p>

<p>The waterfall model is a relatively linear sequential design approach
for certain areas of engineering design. In software development, it
tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as
progress flows in largely one direction (&quot;downwards&quot; like a waterfall)
through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design,
construction, testing, deployment and maintenance.</p>
<p>The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and
construction industries; where the highly structured physical
environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive
much sooner in the development process. When first adopted for software
development, there were no recognized alternatives for knowledge-based
creative work</p>
<p>The Waterfall methodology came about by mistake due to a
misunderstanding a 1970 paper which gave it as an example of a
methodology along with a comment that states this is a risky method and
invites failure. A US Department of Defense standard was published in
1985 with a methodology based on the 1970 paper and it then became
widespread.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi or WiFi is technology for radio wireless local area networking of
devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. Wi Fi is a trademark of the
Wi-Fi Alliance, which restricts the use of the term Wi-Fi Certified to
products that successfully complete interoperability certification
testing.</p>
<p>Devices that can use Wi-Fi technology include desktops and laptops,
video game consoles, smartphones and tablets, smart TVs, digital audio
players and modern printers. Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the
Internet via a WLAN and a wireless access point. Such an access point
(or hotspot) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a
greater range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single
room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square
kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points.</p>
<p>Depiction of a device sending information wirelessly to another device,
both connected to the local network, in order to print a document<br />
Wi-Fi most commonly uses the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5.8 gigahertz
(5 cm) SHF ISM radio bands, these bands are subdivided into multiple
channels. Each channel can be time-shared by multiple networks. These
wavelengths work best for line-of-sight. Many common materials absorb or
reflect them, which further restricts range, but can tend to help
minimise interference between different networks in crowded
environments. At close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on
suitable hardware[disambiguation needed] can achieve speeds of over 1
Gbps.</p>
<p>Anyone within range with a wireless network interface controller can
attempt to access a network; because of this, Wi-Fi is more vulnerable
to attack (called eavesdropping) than wired networks. Wi-Fi Protected
Access is a family of technologies created to protect information moving
across Wi-Fi networks and includes solutions for personal and enterprise
networks. Security features of Wi-Fi Protected Access have included
stronger protections and new security practices as the security
landscape has changed over time.</p>

<p>Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access</p>
<p>WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a family of
wireless communication standards based on the IEEE 802.16 set of
standards, which provide multiple physical layer (PHY) and Media Access
Control (MAC) options.</p>
<p>The name &quot;WiMAX&quot; was created by the WiMAX Forum, which was formed in
June 2001 to promote conformity and interoperability of the standard,
including the definition of predefined system profiles for commercial
vendors. The forum describes WiMAX as &quot;a standards-based technology
enabling the delivery of last mile wireless broadband access as an
alternative to cable and DSL&quot;. IEEE 802.16m or WirelessMAN-Advanced was
a candidate for the 4G, in competition with the LTE Advanced standard.</p>
<p>WiMAX was initially designed to provide 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data
rates, with the 2011 update providing up to 1 Gbit/s for fixed stations</p>

written using a simplified markup language and often edited with the
help of a rich-text editor.</p>
<p>A wiki is run using wiki software, otherwise known as a wiki engine. A
wiki engine is a type of content management system, but it differs from
most other such systems, including blog software, in that the content is
created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little
inherent structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs
of the users. There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both
standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems.
Some wiki engines are open source, whereas others are proprietary. Some
permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example,
editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others
may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may be
imposed to organize content.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wireless-mesh-network"><a class="header" href="#wireless-mesh-network">Wireless Mesh Network</a></h1>
<p><img src="Glossary/w/./images/15009225.png?width=479" alt="" /><br />
A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a communications network made up of
radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. It is also a form of wireless
ad hoc network.</p>
<p>A mesh refers to rich interconnection among devices or nodes. Wireless
mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways.
Mobility of nodes is less frequent. If nodes were to constantly or
frequently move, the mesh will spend more time updating routes than
delivering data. In a wireless mesh network, topology tends to be more
static, so that routes computation can converge and delivery of data to
their destinations can occur. Hence, this is a low-mobility centralized
form of wireless ad hoc network. Also, because it sometimes relies on
static nodes to act as gateways, it is not a truly all-wireless ad hoc
network.</p>
<p>The mesh clients are often laptops, cell phones and other wireless
devices while the mesh routers forward traffic to and from the gateways
which may, but need not, be connected to the Internet. The coverage area
of the radio nodes working as a single network is sometimes called a
mesh cloud. Access to this mesh cloud is dependent on the radio nodes
working in harmony with each other to create a radio network. A mesh
network is reliable and offers redundancy. When one node can no longer
operate, the rest of the nodes can still communicate with each other,
directly or through one or more intermediate nodes. Wireless mesh
networks can self form and self heal. Wireless mesh networks work with
different wireless technologies including 802.11, 802.15, 802.16,
cellular technologies and need not be restricted to any one technology
or protocol.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wireless-repeater"><a class="header" href="#wireless-repeater">Wireless Repeater</a></h1>
<p>A wireless repeater (also called wireless range extender) takes an
existing signal from a wireless router or wireless access point and
rebroadcasts it to create a second network. When two or more hosts have
to be connected with one another over the IEEE 802.11 protocol and the
distance is too long for a direct connection to be established, a
wireless repeater is used to bridge the gap. It can be a specialized
stand alone computer networking device. Also, some Wireless network
interface controllers (WNIC)s optionally support operating in such a
mode. Those outside of the primary network will be able to connect
through the new &quot;repeated&quot; network. However, as far as the original
router or access point is concerned, only the repeater MAC is connected,
making it necessary to enable safety features on the wireless repeater.
Wireless repeaters are commonly used to improve signal range and
strength within homes and small offices.</p>

Consultative Committee (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and
finalized in a publication known as The Orange Book in 1976.</p>
<p>X.25 networks were popular during the 1980s with telecommunications
companies and in financial transaction systems such as automated teller

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="x509"><a class="header" href="#x509">X.509</a></h1>
<p>In cryptography, X.509 is an International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
standard defining the format of public key certificates. X.509
certificates are used in many Internet protocols, including TLS/SSL,
which is the basis for HTTPS, the secure protocol for browsing the web.
They are also used in offline applications, like electronic signatures.</p>
<p>An X.509 certificate binds an identity to a public key using a digital
signature. A certificate contains an identity (a hostname, or an
organization, or an individual) and a public key (RSA, DSA, ECDSA,
ed25519, etc.), and is either signed by a certificate authority or is
self-signed. When a certificate is signed by a trusted certificate
authority, or validated by other means, someone holding that certificate
can use the public key it contains to establish secure communications
with another party, or validate documents digitally signed by the
corresponding private key.</p>
<p>X.509 also defines certificate revocation lists, which are a means to
distribute information about certificates that have been deemed invalid
by a signing authority, as well as a certification path validation
algorithm, which allows for certificates to be signed by intermediate CA
certificates, which are, in turn, signed by other certificates,
eventually reaching a trust anchor.</p>
<p>X.509 is defined by the International Telecommunications Union's
&quot;Standardization Sector&quot; (ITU-T), in ITU-T Study Group 17 and is based
on ASN.1, another ITU-T standard.</p>

documents of that type, above and beyond the basic syntactical
constraints imposed by XML itself. These constraints are generally
expressed using some combination of grammatical rules governing the
order of elements, Boolean predicates that the content must satisfy,
data types governing the content of elements and attributes, and more
specialized rules such as uniqueness and referential integrity
constraints.</p>
<p>There are languages developed specifically to express XML schemas. The
Document Type Definition (DTD) language, which is native to the XML
specification, is a schema language that is of relatively limited
capability, but that also has other uses in XML aside from the
expression of schemas. Two more expressive XML schema languages in
widespread use are XML Schema (with a capital S) and RELAX NG.</p>
<p>The mechanism for associating an XML document with a schema varies
according to the schema language. The association may be achieved via
markup within the XML document itself, or via some external means.</p>

<p>XML-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol which uses XML to
encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism. &quot;XML-RPC&quot; also
refers generically to the use of XML for remote procedure call,
independently of the specific protocol. This article is about the
protocol named &quot;XML-RPC&quot;.</p>

<p>Extensible Markup Language</p>
<p>In computing, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that
defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both
human-readable and machine-readable. The W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and
several other related specifications---all of them free open
standards---define XML.</p>
<p>The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability
across the Internet.[5] It is a textual data format with strong
support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design
of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the
representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web
services.</p>
<p>Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based
languages, while programmers have developed many application programming
interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="xmpp"><a class="header" href="#xmpp">XMPP</a></h1>
<p>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocols</p>
<p>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a communication
protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup
Language). It enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet
extensible data between any two or more network entities. Originally
named Jabber, the protocol was developed by the Jabber open-source
community in 1999 for near real-time instant messaging (IM), presence
information, and contact list maintenance. Designed to be extensible,
the protocol has been used also for publish-subscribe systems,
signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, the Internet of
Things (IoT) applications such as the smart grid, and social networking
services.</p>
<p>Unlike most instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open
standard and uses an open systems approach of development and
application, by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and
interoperate with other organizations' implementations. Because XMPP is
an open protocol, implementations can be developed using any software
license and many server, client, and library implementations are
distributed as free and open-source software, numerous freeware and
commercial software implementations also exist.</p>
<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed an XMPP working group
in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and
presence technology. The XMPP Working group produced four specifications
(RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923), which were approved as
Proposed Standards in 2004. In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were
superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122
specifying the XMPP address format. In 2015, RFC 6122 was superseded by
RFC 7622. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF,
the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation)
is active in developing open XMPP extensions.</p>

<p>Cross Site Scripting</p>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability
typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject
client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site
scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access
controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried
out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security
vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007. Bug bounty company
HackerOne in 2017 reported that XSS is still a major threat vector. XSS
effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk,
depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site
and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's
owner.</p>

<p>XSD (XML Schema Definition), a recommendation of the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an
Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers
to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can check if it
adheres to the description of the element it is placed in.</p>
<p>Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules
to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered &quot;valid&quot;
according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages,
XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document's
validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific
data types. Such a post-validation infoset can be useful in the
development of XML document processing software.</p>

<p>YAML Ain't Markup Language</p>
<p>YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly
used for configuration files and in applications where data is being
stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications
applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal
syntax which intentionally differs from SGML. It uses both Python-style
indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses
[...] for lists and {...} for maps thus JSON files are valid YAML 1.2.</p>
<p>Custom data types are allowed, but YAML natively encodes scalars (such
as strings, integers, and floats), lists, and associative arrays (also
known as maps, dictionaries or hashes). These data types are based on
the Perl programming language, though all commonly used high-level
programming languages share very similar concepts. The colon-centered
syntax, used for expressing key-value pairs, is inspired by electronic
mail headers as defined in RFC 822, and the document separator --- is
borrowed from MIME (RFC 2046). Escape sequences are reused from C, and
whitespace wrapping for multi-line strings is inspired by HTML. Lists
and hashes can contain nested lists and hashes, forming a tree
structure; arbitrary graphs can be represented using YAML aliases
(similar to XML in SOAP). YAML is intended to be read and written in
streams, a feature inspired by SAX.</p>
<p>The official recommended filename extension for YAML files is .yaml</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="zigbee"><a class="header" href="#zigbee">ZigBee</a></h1>
<p>Zigbee is an IEEE 802.15.4-based specification for a suite of high-level
communication protocols used to create personal area networks with
small, low-power digital radios, such as for home automation, medical
device data collection, and other low-power low-bandwidth needs,
designed for small scale projects which need wireless connection. Hence,
Zigbee is a low-power, low data rate, and close proximity (i.e.,
personal area) wireless ad hoc network.</p>
<p>The technology defined by the Zigbee specification is intended to be
simpler and less expensive than other wireless personal area networks
(WPANs), such as Bluetooth or more general wireless networking such as
Wi-Fi. Applications include wireless light switches, home energy
monitors, traffic management systems, and other consumer and industrial
equipment that requires short-range low-rate wireless data transfer.</p>
<p>Its low power consumption limits transmission distances to 10--100
meters line-of-sight, depending on power output and environmental
characteristics. Zigbee devices can transmit data over long distances by
passing data through a mesh network of intermediate devices to reach
more distant ones. Zigbee is typically used in low data rate
applications that require long battery life and secure networking
(Zigbee networks are secured by 128 bit symmetric encryption keys.)
Zigbee has a defined rate of 250 kbit/s, best suited for intermittent
data transmissions from a sensor or input device.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="μ-law"><a class="header" href="#μ-law">μ-law</a></h1>
<p>The µ-law algorithm (sometimes written &quot;mu-law&quot;, often approximated as
&quot;u-law&quot;) is a companding algorithm, primarily used in 8-bit PCM digital
telecommunication systems in North America and Japan. It is one of two
versions of the G.711 standard from ITU-T, the other version being the
similar A-law, used in regions where digital telecommunication signals
are carried on E-1 circuits, e.g. Europe.</p>
<p>Companding algorithms reduce the dynamic range of an audio signal. In
analog systems, this can increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
achieved during transmission; in the digital domain, it can reduce the
quantization error (hence increasing signal to quantization noise
ratio). These SNR increases can be traded instead for reduced bandwidth
for equivalent SNR.</p>

<p><img src="Product/Architecture/HLD/image-4.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>HLD is the big picture of the solution. The purpose of HLD is to provide a common understanding of the system’s architecture among all stakeholders. This helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the system is developed in a consistent manner. HLD also helps to identify potential risks and challenges early on, so that they can be addressed before they become major problems</p>
<h2 id="next-is-how-how-to-write-a-good-hld"><a class="header" href="#next-is-how-how-to-write-a-good-hld">Next is “HOW”. How to write a good HLD?</a></h2>
<p>The key to writing a good HLD is to write it in the form a story, a story so good that the reader is engaged with its plot, the backstories of the characters and is on the edge of his/her seat with every plot twist(Okey we don’t have to go as far as adding plot twists). The idea is to keep the keep the design simple to understand, easy to follow and clear about assumptions and tradeoffs. So naturally the first step is knowing your audience. A good HLD should be able to communicate your thoughts to your expected audience.</p>
<p>Hence a general pattern to follow is</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context</strong> — Scope out and clearly define the objective and context of problem you are solving.</li>
<li><strong>Design Overview</strong>—State the requirements of the solution with additional context like assumptions, back of the envelope calculation of number of users, size of data, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Design</strong> — This contains your actual design of the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Alternatives considered</strong> — This helps you convey comparison between tradeoffs. This is good place to focus of potential bottlenecks with each alternative.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Attributes</strong> — Shed light on property of the system like security, Reliability, Data Integrity, Privacy, Scalability, Latency, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Operations</strong> — Plan for maintenance of code like the monitoring, alerting and logging strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find below a template which you can refer and follow. Based on your audience, not all sections will apply to your HLD. Use your judgement to delete a section and introduce new ones. Have fun!</p>
<h2 id="context-10"><a class="header" href="#context-10">Context</a></h2>
<h3 id="objective"><a class="header" href="#objective">Objective</a></h3>
<p>In one of two sentences, describe at high level what you are solving using this design. This section should not describe the problem (use “Background”) or propose a solution(use “Design”), not should it got into implementation details like stating list of requirements and features.</p>
<h3 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h3>
<p>Provide context for an unfamiliar reader to understand the proposal. In a crisp way cover what the problem is, why it is important to solve the problem and the historical context as appropriate. If the background requires a large write up or the reason to for solving the problem becomes verbose, separate docs like PRDs should be created first and linked here. Note: this is background, do not write about your design or ideas to solve the problem here.</p>
<h2 id="design-1"><a class="header" href="#design-1">Design</a></h2>
<h3 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h3>

<h3 id="functional-requirements"><a class="header" href="#functional-requirements">Functional Requirements</a></h3>
<p>Describe in brief the various aspects of the problem space like</p>
<ol>
<li>What will the users do</li>

<h3 id="interfaces"><a class="header" href="#interfaces">Interfaces</a></h3>
<p>List out key interaction points between user and your system. Typically this has your API details like request and response parameters at a high level.</p>
<h3 id="data-model"><a class="header" href="#data-model">Data Model</a></h3>
<p>This describes key entities of your solution. This space usually helps you to decide till which granularity do you want to break down your entities</p>
<h2 id="detailed-design-1"><a class="header" href="#detailed-design-1">Detailed Design</a></h2>
<h3 id="details"><a class="header" href="#details">Details</a></h3>
<p>Get into the detail of the design. Diagrams are best way to express the thought process here. You can start by drawing out the components( which has one or more Data Models identified in earlier section) and connecting them to each other(This is usually called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_diagram">Component Diagram</a>” and shows high level overview of how components are placed and interact with each others and users of the system).</p>
<p>Optionally, based on complexity of the proposal, you can have multiple types of diagrams like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">Sequence Diagram</a> (Good for representing a solution with cross-section of multiple use-cases across components and actors), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram">Activity Diagram</a>(Helpful in representing how multiple components can be clubbed together), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_diagram">Deployment Diagram</a>(If you want to get to lower level details), etc. Please choose diagrams which best explain your solution as every problem statement, and every solution is different.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies"><a class="header" href="#dependencies">Dependencies</a></h3>
<p>Discuss your dependencies on other components and services. The fall-back plan when they’re unavailable for a period of time? Which services<br />
must be running for your job to start up?<br />
Are you introducing any cycles, such as blocking on a service that can’t run if your jobs aren’t already up?</p>
<p><img src="Product/Architecture/HLD/image-3.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h3 id="migrations"><a class="header" href="#migrations">Migrations</a></h3>
<p>Describe any data or system migrations which might be needed. Incomplete migrations hurt a system in the long run; they add<br />
enormous complexity, hurt reliability, and make programming unpleasant. If existing systems must be turned down to achieve the proposed design, describe how that transition will happen. “How do we get there from here?” is difficult, but often overlooked.</p>
<h3 id="technical-debt-1"><a class="header" href="#technical-debt-1">Technical debt</a></h3>
<p>Things to consider</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there known technical debt incurred by implementing this design?</li>
<li>Is there a risk associated with technical debt (e.g., deprecation of underlying technologies) incurred by implementing this design?</li>
<li>How will technical debt identified during the execution of this design be tracked and followed up with?</li>
<li>Are there libraries or code paths that would be deprecated? If so, what is the plan to migrate the usage to the new piece.</li>
<li>Are there libraries or code paths that would be obsolete? When will they be deleted?</li>
<li>Are there any servers that could be turned down? If so, please document the turndown process.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Product/Architecture/HLD/image-2.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h3 id="potential-patents"><a class="header" href="#potential-patents">Potential patents</a></h3>
<p>Are there potentially patentable inventions in the project?<br />
The work may be patentable if the design:<br />
● Provides for something not otherwise commercially available.<br />
● Does something better/faster/cheaper than what currently exists.<br />
● Addresses an unresolved need.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-considered-1"><a class="header" href="#alternatives-considered-1">Alternatives considered</a></h2>
<p>Clearly list the other potential approaches to meeting the objective that you considered and why the current proposal was ultimately selected. In the rare cases where requirements or system constraints only allow for one possible high-level approach, that should be highlighted here and alternatives to specific details should still be discussed in-line in the detailed design section.<br />
An effective strategy is to compare dimensions of the solution space and how they vary across alternatives, such as latency, data staleness, cpu cost, engineering investment, etc. A color-coded table explaining favorability in that dimension and how important it is from green through yellow, orange and red quickly conveys the rationale to a reader, though this is just<br />
one possible approach to explain the trade-offs. For example:</p>
<p><img src="Product/Architecture/HLD/image-1.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h2 id="quality-attributes"><a class="header" href="#quality-attributes">Quality attributes</a></h2>
<h3 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h3>
<p>Think about potential attacks on your system and describe the counter-measures you have in-place to prevent or mitigate each<br />
attack. For each attack describe the worst case impact it would have. Also, list any known vulnerabilities or potentially insecure dependencies. If<br />
somehow your application doesn’t have security considerations, explicitly state so and why.</p>
<p>Please consider attacks from a variety of sources, including both external and internal risks. When evaluating insider risk, include both insider risk from your co-employees as well as insider risk for customers (e.g. for enterprise products, employees of an enterprise; for consumer products,<br />
family members or friends of customers)</p>
<h3 id="reliability"><a class="header" href="#reliability">Reliability</a></h3>
<p>Discuss handling of local data loss, transient errors (e.g., temporary outages) and how they affect your system. Bear in mind that reliability issues with your dependencies can often cause reliability issues for your system.</p>
<p>What do you use that inherently provides reliability and redundancy for data? What do you use that requires data to be backed up? How is the data backed up? How is it restored? What happens between the time data is lost and the time it’s restored? In the case of a partial loss, can you keep serving and can you restore only missing portions of your backups to your serving datastore?</p>
<p>What are the costs of replicating your data?</p>
<h3 id="data-integrity"><a class="header" href="#data-integrity">Data integrity</a></h3>
<p>Discuss how you will detect, provision for and recover from data corruption and loss.</p>
<p>How will you find out about data corruption or loss in your datastores? What sources of data loss are detected? (User error, application bug, storage platform bug, site/replica disaster.)</p>
<p>How long will it take to notice each of these types of losses? What is your plan to recover from each of these types of losses?</p>
<h3 id="privacy"><a class="header" href="#privacy">Privacy</a></h3>
<p>Does your solution cover privacy standards in place? Is the customer PII protected by sufficient firewalls and encryptions? Are your private keys sufficiently protected?</p>
<h3 id="scalability"><a class="header" href="#scalability">Scalability</a></h3>
<p>How does your system scale? Consider both data size increase (if applicable) and traffic increase (if applicable).</p>
<p>Please consider the current machine situation: adding more machines might take much longer than you think or might not happen during the lifetime of your project. What initial resources will you need? Plan early and carefully. Also, general machine utilization is a concern, using<br />
more resources than you need will block expansion of your service.</p>
<h3 id="latency-1"><a class="header" href="#latency-1">Latency</a></h3>
<p>This section can be skipped if you are not designing a server on a human facing path. What latency do you need/expect? In particular, make sure you understand the bottlenecks of the pieces you’re reusing. All services should define latency targets.</p>
<h3 id="testability"><a class="header" href="#testability">Testability</a></h3>
<p>Specify the test plan. What are the sub-units of your system that will be independently testable?</p>
<p>How do you plan to test them? For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a test harness around it that simulates its environment</li>
<li><em>Generate random/carefully controlled input data</em></li>
<li>Compare with golden results/maintain state in the test harness</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you tests run automatically by the CI/CD pipelines</p>
<p>What load can your server handle, and how will you verify that value?</p>
<p>If there are changes envisaged in your future work, would your tests verify the base functionality? If some of your tests cannot be easily automated, how will you document the needed special procedures?</p>
<p>Consider the external systems your system depends on</p>
<ul>
<li>How fast will your unit test cycle run?</li>
<li>What test infrastructure (e.g. test doubles) from external systems will you use?</li>
<li>Does the external system have a test instance for integration testing?</li>
<li>Do you need any tests that run outside of the standard unit test cycle (e.g. presubmit, postsubmit, or release)?<br />
Consider future systems that will depend on yours. What test facilities (e.g. test doubles, local instances for exploratory integration tests) will you provide so that they can run integration tests?</li>
</ul>

<p>All systems must log information at various levels for the log analysis system to collect and analyze. Log information allows us to understand system user behavior and system related business metrics. In this section, describe the information that you are going to log.</p>
<h3 id="rollback-strategy"><a class="header" href="#rollback-strategy">Rollback strategy</a></h3>
<p>In order to improve incident management response, which will result in reduced time to mitigate issues, teams should document and test their ability to rollback major change surfaces. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

This helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the system is developed in a consistent manner. HLD also helps to identify potential risks and challenges early on, so that they can be addressed before they become major problems</p>
<h2 id="next-is-how-how-to-write-a-good-hld-1"><a class="header" href="#next-is-how-how-to-write-a-good-hld-1">Next is “HOW”. How to write a good HLD?</a></h2>
<p>The key to writing a good HLD is to write it in the form a story, a story so good that the reader is engaged with its plot, the backstories of the characters and is on the edge of his/her seat with every plot twist(Okey we don’t have to go as far as adding plot twists). The idea is to keep the keep the design simple to understand, easy to follow and clear about assumptions and tradeoffs. So naturally the first step is knowing your audience. A good HLD should be able to communicate your thoughts to your expected audience.</p>
<p>Hence a general pattern to follow is</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context</strong> — Scope out and clearly define the objective and context of problem you are solving.</li>
<li><strong>Design Overview</strong>—State the requirements of the solution with additional context like assumptions, back of the envelope calculation of number of users, size of data, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Design</strong> — This contains your actual design of the solution.</li>
<li><strong>Alternatives considered</strong> — This helps you convey comparison between tradeoffs. This is good place to focus of potential bottlenecks with each alternative.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Attributes</strong> — Shed light on property of the system like security, Reliability, Data Integrity, Privacy, Scalability, Latency, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Operations</strong> — Plan for maintenance of code like the monitoring, alerting and logging strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Find below a template which you can refer and follow. Based on your audience, not all sections will apply to your HLD. Use your judgement to delete a section and introduce new ones. Have fun!</p>
<h2 id="context-11"><a class="header" href="#context-11">Context</a></h2>
<h3 id="objective-1"><a class="header" href="#objective-1">Objective</a></h3>
<p>In one of two sentences, describe at high level what you are solving using this design. This section should not describe the problem (use “Background”) or propose a solution(use “Design”), not should it got into implementation details like stating list of requirements and features.</p>
<h3 id="background-1"><a class="header" href="#background-1">Background</a></h3>
<p>Provide context for an unfamiliar reader to understand the proposal. In a crisp way cover what the problem is, why it is important to solve the problem and the historical context as appropriate. If the background requires a large write up or the reason to for solving the problem becomes verbose, separate docs like PRDs should be created first and linked here. Note: this is background, do not write about your design or ideas to solve the problem here.</p>
<h2 id="design-2"><a class="header" href="#design-2">Design</a></h2>
<h3 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h3>
<p>This contains high level overview of your design. Should be understandable by a non-engineer not working on the project. Diagrams can be especially useful to quickly convey the shape of the solution. This is going to be the trailer of your story, so keep it clean and concise.</p>
<h3 id="functional-requirements-1"><a class="header" href="#functional-requirements-1">Functional Requirements</a></h3>
<p>Describe in brief the various aspects of the problem space like</p>
<ol>
<li>What will the users do</li>
<li>Where are users based out of geographically</li>
<li>Which platforms, like mobile/web/physical would the users be using.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="capacity-estimates-1"><a class="header" href="#capacity-estimates-1">Capacity Estimates</a></h3>
<p>Calculate approximates for the key data points. You can use below calculation for reference.<br />
<strong>Active Users</strong> — 2 Billion(B) Daily Active Users(DAU), 3B Monthly Active Users(MAU) — Approximate FB traffic estimate<br />
<strong>Read vs Write</strong> — 100:1<br />
<strong>Queries Per Second</strong> —<br />
Reads — (2B DAU)*(100Read)/(24*60*60) — 2.4M req/sec<br />
Writes — (2B DAU)*(1Write)/(24*60*60) — 24k req/sec<br />
<strong>Storage</strong> — (Assuming for 5 years)<br />
No of objects — (2B DAU)*(5Y*12M*30D) — 3.6 Trillion(T)<br />
Each Object Size — ~ 500 bytes<br />
Total Object size — 3.6T*500 bytes — 1.8 PB<br />
<strong>Throughput</strong> —<br />
Reads — (2.4M QPS)*(500bytes) — 1200 MB/s<br />
Writes — (24K QPS)*(500bytes) — 12 MB/s<br />
Cache — Following 80–20 rule. 20 % users would use 80% of objs) — (1200 MB/s)*(60m*60s)*(0.2) — 864 GB per hour<br />
<strong>Number of Instances required</strong> —<br />
Application Services —<br />
Assuming 100 MB/s per instance as bottleneck— (1200MBps/100MBps)=12<br />
Database —<br />
Assuming 10 TB per instance as bottleneck— 1.8PB/10TB= 180<br />
Assuming 50 MBps disk throughput per instance as bottleneck — 1200MB/s/50 MB/s= 24<br />
Caching — Assuming each instance offers 32 GB — 864/64 = 14</p>
<h3 id="interfaces-1"><a class="header" href="#interfaces-1">Interfaces</a></h3>
<p>List out key interaction points between user and your system. Typically this has your API details like request and response parameters at a high level.</p>
<h3 id="data-model-1"><a class="header" href="#data-model-1">Data Model</a></h3>
<p>This describes key entities of your solution. This space usually helps you to decide till which granularity do you want to break down your entities</p>
<h2 id="detailed-design-2"><a class="header" href="#detailed-design-2">Detailed Design</a></h2>
<h3 id="details-1"><a class="header" href="#details-1">Details</a></h3>
<p>Get into the detail of the design. Diagrams are best way to express the thought process here. You can start by drawing out the components( which has one or more Data Models identified in earlier section) and connecting them to each other(This is usually called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_diagram">Component Diagram</a>” and shows high level overview of how components are placed and interact with each others and users of the system).</p>
<p>Optionally, based on complexity of the proposal, you can have multiple types of diagrams like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">Sequence Diagram</a> (Good for representing a solution with cross-section of multiple use-cases across components and actors), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram">Activity Diagram</a>(Helpful in representing how multiple components can be clubbed together), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_diagram">Deployment Diagram</a>(If you want to get to lower level details), etc. Please choose diagrams which best explain your solution as every problem statement, and every solution is different.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies-1"><a class="header" href="#dependencies-1">Dependencies</a></h3>
<p>Discuss your dependencies on other components and services. The fall-back plan when they’re unavailable for a period of time? Which services<br />
must be running for your job to start up?<br />
Are you introducing any cycles, such as blocking on a service that can’t run if your jobs aren’t already up?</p>
<p><img src="Product/Architecture/HLD/image-3.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h3 id="migrations-1"><a class="header" href="#migrations-1">Migrations</a></h3>
<p>Describe any data or system migrations which might be needed. Incomplete migrations hurt a system in the long run; they add<br />
enormous complexity, hurt reliability, and make programming unpleasant. If existing systems must be turned down to achieve the proposed design, describe how that transition will happen. “How do we get there from here?” is difficult, but often overlooked.</p>
<h3 id="technical-debt-2"><a class="header" href="#technical-debt-2">Technical debt</a></h3>
<p>Things to consider</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there known technical debt incurred by implementing this design?</li>
<li>Is there a risk associated with technical debt (e.g., deprecation of underlying technologies) incurred by implementing this design?</li>
<li>How will technical debt identified during the execution of this design be tracked and followed up with?</li>
<li>Are there libraries or code paths that would be deprecated? If so, what is the plan to migrate the usage to the new piece.</li>
<li>Are there libraries or code paths that would be obsolete? When will they be deleted?</li>
<li>Are there any servers that could be turned down? If so, please document the turndown process.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Product/Architecture/HLD/image-2.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h3 id="potential-patents-1"><a class="header" href="#potential-patents-1">Potential patents</a></h3>
<p>Are there potentially patentable inventions in the project?<br />
The work may be patentable if the design:<br />
● Provides for something not otherwise commercially available.<br />
● Does something better/faster/cheaper than what currently exists.<br />
● Addresses an unresolved need.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-considered-2"><a class="header" href="#alternatives-considered-2">Alternatives considered</a></h2>
<p>Clearly list the other potential approaches to meeting the objective that you considered and why the current proposal was ultimately selected. In the rare cases where requirements or system constraints only allow for one possible high-level approach, that should be highlighted here and alternatives to specific details should still be discussed in-line in the detailed design section.<br />
An effective strategy is to compare dimensions of the solution space and how they vary across alternatives, such as latency, data staleness, cpu cost, engineering investment, etc. A color-coded table explaining favorability in that dimension and how important it is from green through yellow, orange and red quickly conveys the rationale to a reader, though this is just<br />
one possible approach to explain the trade-offs. For example:</p>
<p><img src="Product/Architecture/HLD/image-1.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<h2 id="quality-attributes-1"><a class="header" href="#quality-attributes-1">Quality attributes</a></h2>
<h3 id="security-1"><a class="header" href="#security-1">Security</a></h3>
<p>Think about potential attacks on your system and describe the counter-measures you have in-place to prevent or mitigate each<br />
attack. For each attack describe the worst case impact it would have. Also, list any known vulnerabilities or potentially insecure dependencies. If<br />
somehow your application doesn’t have security considerations, explicitly state so and why.</p>
<p>Please consider attacks from a variety of sources, including both external and internal risks. When evaluating insider risk, include both insider risk from your co-employees as well as insider risk for customers (e.g. for enterprise products, employees of an enterprise; for consumer products,<br />
family members or friends of customers)</p>
<h3 id="reliability-1"><a class="header" href="#reliability-1">Reliability</a></h3>
<p>Discuss handling of local data loss, transient errors (e.g., temporary outages) and how they affect your system. Bear in mind that reliability issues with your dependencies can often cause reliability issues for your system.</p>
<p>What do you use that inherently provides reliability and redundancy for data? What do you use that requires data to be backed up? How is the data backed up? How is it restored? What happens between the time data is lost and the time it’s restored? In the case of a partial loss, can you keep serving and can you restore only missing portions of your backups to your serving datastore?</p>
<p>What are the costs of replicating your data?</p>
<h3 id="data-integrity-1"><a class="header" href="#data-integrity-1">Data integrity</a></h3>
<p>Discuss how you will detect, provision for and recover from data corruption and loss.</p>
<p>How will you find out about data corruption or loss in your datastores? What sources of data loss are detected? (User error, application bug, storage platform bug, site/replica disaster.)</p>
<p>How long will it take to notice each of these types of losses? What is your plan to recover from each of these types of losses?</p>
<h3 id="privacy-1"><a class="header" href="#privacy-1">Privacy</a></h3>
<p>Does your solution cover privacy standards in place? Is the customer PII protected by sufficient firewalls and encryptions? Are your private keys sufficiently protected?</p>
<h3 id="scalability-1"><a class="header" href="#scalability-1">Scalability</a></h3>
<p>How does your system scale? Consider both data size increase (if applicable) and traffic increase (if applicable).</p>
<p>Please consider the current machine situation: adding more machines might take much longer than you think or might not happen during the lifetime of your project. What initial resources will you need? Plan early and carefully. Also, general machine utilization is a concern, using<br />
more resources than you need will block expansion of your service.</p>
<h3 id="latency-2"><a class="header" href="#latency-2">Latency</a></h3>
<p>This section can be skipped if you are not designing a server on a human facing path. What latency do you need/expect? In particular, make sure you understand the bottlenecks of the pieces you’re reusing. All services should define latency targets.</p>
<h3 id="testability-1"><a class="header" href="#testability-1">Testability</a></h3>
<p>Specify the test plan. What are the sub-units of your system that will be independently testable?</p>
<p>How do you plan to test them? For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a test harness around it that simulates its environment</li>
<li><em>Generate random/carefully controlled input data</em></li>
<li>Compare with golden results/maintain state in the test harness</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you tests run automatically by the CI/CD pipelines</p>
<p>What load can your server handle, and how will you verify that value?</p>
<p>If there are changes envisaged in your future work, would your tests verify the base functionality? If some of your tests cannot be easily automated, how will you document the needed special procedures?</p>
<p>Consider the external systems your system depends on</p>
<ul>
<li>How fast will your unit test cycle run?</li>
<li>What test infrastructure (e.g. test doubles) from external systems will you use?</li>
<li>Does the external system have a test instance for integration testing?</li>
<li>Do you need any tests that run outside of the standard unit test cycle (e.g. presubmit, postsubmit, or release)?<br />
Consider future systems that will depend on yours. What test facilities (e.g. test doubles, local instances for exploratory integration tests) will you provide so that they can run integration tests?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Product/Architecture/HLD/image.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
<p>Why you should have a good test!</p>
<h2 id="operations-1"><a class="header" href="#operations-1">Operations</a></h2>
<h3 id="slas-1"><a class="header" href="#slas-1">SLAs</a></h3>
<p>If your application makes any service level guarantees, what mechanisms are in place for auditing, monitoring, etc.? And how can you guarantee the stated level of reliability?</p>
<h3 id="monitoring--alerting-1"><a class="header" href="#monitoring--alerting-1">Monitoring &amp; alerting</a></h3>
<p>Is there a mechanism for monitoring and alerting for the running system. Is there an oncall and escalation metrics?</p>
<h3 id="logging-plan-1"><a class="header" href="#logging-plan-1">Logging plan</a></h3>
<p>All systems must log information at various levels for the log analysis system to collect and analyze. Log information allows us to understand system user behavior and system related business metrics. In this section, describe the information that you are going to log.</p>
<h3 id="rollback-strategy-1"><a class="header" href="#rollback-strategy-1">Rollback strategy</a></h3>
<p>In order to improve incident management response, which will result in reduced time to mitigate issues, teams should document and test their ability to rollback major change surfaces. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documenting the overall rollback strategy;</li>
<li>Identifying surface areas which are not able to be rolled back and defining a fix-forward strategy.</li>
