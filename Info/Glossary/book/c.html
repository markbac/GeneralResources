<h2 id="c-language"><a class="header" href="#c-language">C Language</a></h2>
<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language,
supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion,
while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By
design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine
instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications
that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating
systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging
from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
<p>C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at
Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has
since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all
time, with C compilers from various vendors available for the
majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has
been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
<p>C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled
using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access
to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to
machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite
its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage
cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C
program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms
and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language
has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded
microcontrollers to supercomputers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.c}">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
   return 0;
}

<h2 id="c-1"><a class="header" href="#c-1">C++</a></h2>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative,
object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing
facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
<p>It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded,
resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and
flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found
useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software
infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop
applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL servers), and
performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space
probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it
available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers,
including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.</p>
<p>C++ is standardized by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version
ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017
(informally known as C+17). The C+ programming language was initially
standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by
the C+03, C11 and C14 standards. The current C17 standard supersedes
these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the
initial standardization in 1998, C+ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup
at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he wanted
an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided
high-level features for program organization. C++20 is the next planned
standard thereafter.</p>

<h2 id="ca"><a class="header" href="#ca">CA</a></h2>
<p>Certificate Authority</p>
<p>In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA)
is an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate
certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the
certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon
signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds
to the certified public key. A CA acts as a trusted third
party---trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by
the party relying upon the certificate. The format of these certificates
is specified by the X.509 standard.</p>
<p>One particularly common use for certificate authorities is to sign
certificates used in HTTPS, the secure browsing protocol for the World
Wide Web. Another common use is in issuing identity cards by national
governments for use in electronically signing documents.</p>

<h2 id="camel"><a class="header" href="#camel">CAMEL</a></h2>
<p>Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic</p>
<p>Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) is a
set of standards designed to work on either a GSM core network or the
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network. The framework
provides tools for operators to define additional features for standard
GSM services/UMTS services. The CAMEL architecture is based on the
Intelligent Network (IN) standards, and uses the CAP protocol. The
protocols are codified in a series of ETSI Technical Specifications.</p>
<p>Many services can be created using CAMEL, and it is particularly
effective in allowing these services to be offered when a subscriber is
roaming, like, for instance, no-prefix dialing (the number the user
dials is the same no matter the country where the call is placed) or
seamless MMS message access from abroad.</p>
<h2 id="camel-case"><a class="header" href="#camel-case">Camel Case</a></h2>
<p>Camel case (stylized as camelCase or CamelCase; also known as camel caps
or more formally as medial capitals) is the practice of writing compound
words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of
the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or
punctuation. Common examples include &quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;eBay&quot;, &quot;FedEx&quot;,
&quot;DreamWorks&quot;, and &quot;HarperCollins&quot;. It is also sometimes used in online
usernames such as &quot;JohnSmith&quot;, and to make multi-word domain names more
legible, for example in advertisements.</p>
<p>Programming and coding<br />
The use of medial caps for compound identifiers is recommended by the
coding style guidelines of many organizations or software
projects. For some languages (such as Mesa, Pascal, Modula, Java and
Microsoft's .NET) this practice is recommended by the language
developers or by authoritative manuals and has therefore become part of
the language's &quot;culture&quot;.</p>
<p>Style guidelines often distinguish between upper and lower camel case,
typically specifying which variety should be used for specific kinds of
entities: variables, record fields, methods, procedures, types, etc.
These rules are sometimes supported by static analysis tools that check
source code for adherence.</p>
<p>The original Hungarian notation for programming, for example, specifies
that a lowercase abbreviation for the &quot;usage type&quot; (not data type)
should prefix all variable names, with the remainder of the name in
upper camel case; as such it is a form of lower camel case.</p>
<p>Programming identifiers often need to contain acronyms and initialisms
that are already in uppercase, such as &quot;old HTML file&quot;. By analogy with
the title case rules, the natural camel case rendering would have the
abbreviation all in uppercase, namely &quot;oldHTMLFile&quot;. However, this
approach is problematic when two acronyms occur together (e.g., &quot;parse
DBM XML&quot; would become &quot;parseDBMXML&quot;) or when the standard mandates lower
camel case but the name begins with an abbreviation (e.g. &quot;SQL server&quot;
would become &quot;sQLServer&quot;). For this reason, some programmers prefer to
treat abbreviations as if they were lowercase words and write
&quot;oldHtmlFile&quot;, &quot;parseDbmXml&quot; or &quot;sqlServer&quot;. However, this can make it
harder to recognise that a given word is intended as an acronym.</p>
<h2 id="cap"><a class="header" href="#cap">CAP</a></h2>
<p>CAMEL Application Part</p>
<p>The CAMEL Application Part (CAP) is a signalling protocol used in the
Intelligent Network (IN) architecture. CAP is a Remote Operations
Service Element (ROSE) user protocol, and as such is layered on top of
the Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) of the SS#7
protocol suite. CAP is based on a subset of the ETSI Core and allows for
the implementation of carrier-grade, value added services such as
unified messaging, prepaid, fraud control and Freephone in both the GSM
voice and GPRS data networks. CAMEL is a means of adding intelligent
applications to mobile (rather than fixed) networks. It builds upon
established practices in the fixed line telephony business that are
generally classed under the heading of (Intelligent Network Application
Part) or INAP CS-2 protocol</p>

U.S. Department of Defense, who funded the research. The term &quot;maturity&quot;
relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from
ad hoc practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics,
to active optimization of the processes.</p>
<p>The model's aim is to improve existing software development processes,
but it can also be applied to other processes.</p>
<p>Structure<br />
The model involves five aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maturity Levels: a 5-level process maturity continuum - where the
uppermost (5th) level is a notional ideal state where processes
would be systematically managed by a combination of process
optimization and continuous process improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key Process Areas: a Key Process Area identifies a cluster of
related activities that, when performed together, achieve a set of
goals considered important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goals: the goals of a key process area summarize the states that
must exist for that key process area to have been implemented in an
effective and lasting way. The extent to which the goals have been
accomplished is an indicator of how much capability the organization
has established at that maturity level. The goals signify the scope,
boundaries, and intent of each key process area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common Features: common features include practices that implement
and institutionalize a key process area. There are five types of
common features: commitment to perform, ability to perform,
activities performed, measurement and analysis, and verifying
implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key Practices: The key practices describe the elements of
infrastructure and practice that contribute most effectively to the
implementation and institutionalization of the area.</p>
<p>Levels<br />
There are five levels defined along the continuum of the model and,
according to the SEI: &quot;Predictability, effectiveness, and control of
an organization's software processes are believed to improve as the
organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the
empirical evidence to date supports this belief&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point
for use of a new or undocumented repeat process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeatable - the process is at least documented sufficiently such
that repeating the same steps may be attempted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defined - the process is defined/confirmed as a standard business
process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capable - the process is quantitatively managed in accordance with
agreed-upon metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient - process management includes deliberate process
optimization/improvement.</p>
<p>Within each of these maturity levels are Key Process Areas which
characterise that level, and for each such area there are five
factors: goals, commitment, ability, measurement, and verification.
These are not necessarily unique to CMM, representing --- as they do
--- the stages that organizations must go through on the way to
becoming mature.</p>
<p>The model provides a theoretical continuum along which process
maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the next.
Skipping levels is not allowed/feasible.</p>

<h2 id="cat-5"><a class="header" href="#cat-5">Cat 5</a></h2>
<p>Category 5 cable, commonly referred to as Cat 5, is a twisted pair cable
for computer networks. The cable standard provides performance of up to
100 MHz and is suitable for most varieties of Ethernet over twisted
pair. Cat 5 is also used to carry other signals such as telephony and
video.</p>
<p>This cable is commonly connected using punch-down blocks and modular
connectors. Most Category 5 cables are unshielded, relying on the
balanced line twisted pair design and differential signaling for noise
rejection.</p>
<p>The category 5 specification was deprecated in 2001 and is superseded by
the category 5e specification.</p>

<h2 id="cat-6"><a class="header" href="#cat-6">Cat 6</a></h2>
<p>Category 6 cable, commonly referred to as Cat 6, is a standardized
twisted pair cable for Ethernet and other network physical layers that
is backward compatible with the Category 5/5e and Category 3 cable
standards.</p>
<p>Compared with Cat 5 and Cat 5e, Cat 6 features more stringent
specifications for crosstalk and system noise. The cable standard also
specifies performance of up to 250 MHz compared to 100 MHz for Cat 5 and
Cat 5e.</p>
<p>Whereas Category 6 cable has a reduced maximum length of 55 meters when
used for 10GBASE-T, Category 6A cable (or Augmented Category 6) is
characterized to 500 MHz and has improved alien crosstalk
characteristics, allowing 10GBASE-T to be run for the same 100 meter
maximum distance as previous Ethernet variants.</p>

<h2 id="ccs"><a class="header" href="#ccs">CCS</a></h2>
<p>Common Channel Signalling</p>
<p>In telephony, common-channel signaling (CCS), in the US also
common-channel interoffice signaling (CCIS), is the transmission of
signaling information (control information) on a separate channel than
the data, and, more specifically, where that signaling channel controls
multiple data channels.</p>
<p>For example, in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) one channel
of a communications link is typically used for the sole purpose of
carrying signaling for establishment and tear down of telephone calls.
The remaining channels are used entirely for the transmission of voice
data. In most cases, a single 64kbit/s channel is sufficient to handle
the call setup and call clear-down traffic for numerous voice and data
channels.</p>
<p>The logical alternative to CCS is channel-associated signaling (CAS), in
which each bearer channel has a signaling channel dedicated to it.</p>
<p>CCS offers the following advantages over CAS, in the context of the
PSTN:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Faster call set-up time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater trunking efficiency due to the quicker set up and clearing,
thereby reducing traffic on the network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can transfer additional information along with the signaling
traffic, providing features such as caller ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signaling can be performed mid-call</p>
<p>The most common CCS signaling methods in use today are Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Signalling System No. 7 (SS7).</p>
<p>ISDN signaling is used primarily on trunks connecting end-user
private branch exchange (PBX) systems to a central office. SS7 is
primarily used within the PSTN. The two signaling methods are very
similar since they share a common heritage and in some cases, the
same signaling messages are transmitted in both ISDN and SS7.</p>

<h2 id="cdma"><a class="header" href="#cdma">CDMA</a></h2>
<p>Code-division multiple access</p>
<p>Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method used by
various radio communication technologies.</p>
<p>CDMA is an example of multiple access, where several transmitters can
send information simultaneously over a single communication channel.
This allows several users to share a band of frequencies . To permit
this without undue interference between the users, CDMA employs spread
spectrum technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter
is assigned a code).</p>
<p>CDMA is used as the access method in many mobile phone standards. IS-95,
also called &quot;cdmaOne&quot;, and its 3G evolution CDMA2000, are often simply
referred to as &quot;CDMA&quot;, but UMTS, the 3G standard used by GSM carriers,
also uses &quot;wideband CDMA&quot;, or W-CDMA, as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA,
as its radio technologies.</p>

<p>Comfort Noise Generation</p>
<p>Comfort noise (or comfort tone) is synthetic background noise used in
radio and wireless communications to fill the artificial silence in a
transmission resulting from voice activity detection or from the audio
clarity of modern digital lines.</p>
<p>Some modern telephone systems (such as wireless and VoIP) use voice
activity detection (VAD), a form of squelching where low volume levels
are ignored by the transmitting device. In digital audio transmissions,
this saves bandwidth of the communications channel by transmitting
nothing when the source volume is under a certain threshold, leaving
only louder sounds (such as the speaker's voice) to be sent. However,
improvements in background noise reduction technologies can occasionally
result in the complete removal of all noise. Although maximizing call
quality is of primary importance, exhaustive removal of noise may not
properly simulate the typical behavior of terminals on the PSTN system.</p>
<p>The result of receiving total silence, especially for a prolonged
period, has a number of unwanted effects on the listener, including the
following:</p>
<p>the listener may believe that the transmission has been lost, and
therefore hang up prematurely.<br />
the speech may sound &quot;choppy&quot; (see noise gate) and difficult to
understand.<br />
the sudden change in sound level can be jarring to the listener.<br />
To counteract these effects, comfort noise is added, usually on the
receiving end in wireless or VoIP systems, to fill in the silent
portions of transmissions with artificial noise. The noise generated is
at a low but audible volume level, and can vary based on the average
volume level of received signals to minimize jarring transitions.</p>
<p>In many VoIP products, users may control how VAD and comfort noise are
configured, or disable the feature entirely.</p>
<p>As part of the RTP audio video profile, RFC 3389 defines a standard for
distributing comfort noise information in VoIP systems.</p>
<p>A similar concept is that of sidetone, the effect of sound that is
picked up by a telephone's mouthpiece and introduced (at low level) into
the earpiece of the same handset, acting as feedback.</p>
<h2 id="cobol"><a class="header" href="#cobol">Cobol</a></h2>
<p>COBOL is a compiled English-like computer programming language
designed for business use. It is imperative, procedural and, since 2002,
object-oriented. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and
administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still
widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such
as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. But due to its
declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL
programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in
modern languages or replaced with software packages. Most programming in
COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications.</p>
<p>COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on previous
programming language design work by Grace Hopper, commonly referred to
as &quot;the (grand)mother of COBOL&quot;. It was created as part of a US
Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming
language for data processing. Intended as a stopgap, the Department of
Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting
in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has since
been revised four times. Expansions include support for structured and
object-oriented programming. The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014.</p>
<p>COBOL statements have an English-like syntax, which were designed to be
self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses
over 300 reserved words. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like y
= x;, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, MOVE x TO y).
COBOL code is split into four divisions (identification, environment,
data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs
and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies
43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.</p>

<h2 id="compiled-language"><a class="header" href="#compiled-language">Compiled Language</a></h2>
<p>A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are
typically compilers (translators that generate machine code from source
code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code,
where no pre-runtime translation takes place).</p>
<p>The term is somewhat vague. In principle, any language can be
implemented with a compiler or with an interpreter. A combination of
both solutions is also common: a compiler can translate the source code
into some intermediate form (often called p-code or bytecode), which is
then passed to an interpreter which executes it.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-back-end"><a class="header" href="#compiler-back-end">Compiler Back end</a></h2>
<p>The back end takes the optimized IR from the middle end. It may perform
more analysis, transformations and optimizations that are specific for
the target CPU architecture. The back end generates the target-dependent
assembly code, performing register allocation in the process. The back
end performs instruction scheduling, which re-orders instructions to
keep parallel execution units busy by filling delay slots. Although most
algorithms for optimization are NP-hard, heuristic techniques are
well-developed and currently implemented in production-quality
compilers. Typically the output of a back end is machine code
specialized for a particular processor and operating system.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-front-end"><a class="header" href="#compiler-front-end">Compiler Front end</a></h2>
<p>The front end verifies syntax and semantics according to a specific
source language. For statically typed languages it performs type
checking by collecting type information. If the input program is
syntactically incorrect or has a type error, it generates errors and
warnings, highlighting[dubious -- discuss] them on the source code.
Aspects of the front end include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and
semantic analysis. The front end transforms the input program into an
intermediate representation (IR) for further processing by the middle
end. This IR is usually a lower-level representation of the program with
respect to the source code</p>
<h2 id="compiler-middle-end"><a class="header" href="#compiler-middle-end">Compiler Middle end</a></h2>
<p>The middle end performs optimizations on the IR that are independent of
the CPU architecture being targeted. This source code/machine code
independence is intended to enable generic optimizations to be shared
between versions of the compiler supporting different languages and
target processors. Examples of middle end optimizations are removal of
useless (dead code elimination) or unreachable code (reachability
analysis), discovery and propagation of constant values (constant

<h2 id="compiler-preprocessor"><a class="header" href="#compiler-preprocessor">Compiler preprocessor</a></h2>
<p>In computer science, a preprocessor is a program that processes its
input data to produce output that is used as input to another program.
The output is said to be a preprocessed form of the input data, which is
often used by some subsequent programs like compilers. The amount and
kind of processing done depends on the nature of the preprocessor; some
preprocessors are only capable of performing relatively simple textual
substitutions and macro expansions, while others have the power of
full-fledged programming languages.</p>
<p>A common example from computer programming is the processing performed
on source code before the next step of compilation. In some computer
languages (e.g., C and PL/I) there is a phase of translation known as
preprocessing. It can also include macro processing, file inclusion and
language extensions.</p>
<h2 id="complier"><a class="header" href="#complier">Complier</a></h2>
<p>A compiler is computer software that transforms computer code written in
one programming language (the source language) into another programming
language (the target language). Compilers are a type of translator that
support digital devices, primarily computers. The name compiler is
primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level
programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language,
object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.</p>
<p>However, there are many different types of compilers. If the compiled
program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different
from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a
cross-compiler. A bootstrap compiler is written in the language that it
intends to compile. A program that translates from a low-level language
to a higher level one is a decompiler. A program that translates between
high-level languages is usually called a source-to-source compiler or
transpiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the
form of expressions without a change of language. The term
compiler-compiler refers to tools used to create parsers that perform
syntax analysis.</p>
<p>A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations:
preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis
(syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an
intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation.
Compilers implement these operations in phases that promote efficient
design and correct transformations of source input to target output.
Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very
difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler
implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.</p>

variability in these factors contributes variability to project

the variability in the phenomenon itself. As these sources of
variabiility are further investigated and pinned down, the variability
in the project diminishes, and so the variability in the project
estimatescan also diminish. This phenomenon is known as the &quot;Cone of
Uncertainty&quot; which is illustrated in the following figure. As the figure

<h2 id="control-plane"><a class="header" href="#control-plane">Control Plane</a></h2>
<p>In routing, the control plane is the part of the router architecture
that is concerned with drawing the network topology, or the information
in a (possibly augmented) routing table that defines what to do with
incoming packets. Control plane functions, such as participating in
routing protocols, run in the architectural control element. In most
cases, the routing table contains a list of destination addresses and
the outgoing interface(s) associated with them. Control plane logic also
can define certain packets to be discarded, as well as preferential
treatment of certain packets for which a high quality of service is
defined by such mechanisms as differentiated services.</p>
<p>Depending on the specific router implementation, there may be a separate
forwarding information base that is populated (i.e., loaded) by the
control plane, but used by the forwarding plane to look up packets, at
very high speed, and decide how to handle them.<br />

<h2 id="copyleft"><a class="header" href="#copyleft">Copyleft</a></h2>
<p>Copyleft (a play on the word copyright) is the practice of offering
people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of a
work with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in
derivative works down the line. Copyleft software licenses are
considered protective or reciprocal, as contrasted with permissive free
software licenses.</p>
<p>Copyleft is a form of licensing, and can be used to maintain copyright
conditions for works ranging from computer software, to documents, to
art, to scientific discoveries and instruments in medicine. In general,
copyright law is used by an author to prohibit recipients from
reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of their work. In
contrast, under copyleft, an author must give every person who receives
a copy of the work permission to reproduce, adapt, or distribute it,
with the accompanying requirement that any resulting copies or
adaptations are also bound by the same licensing agreement.</p>
<p>Copyleft licenses for software require that information necessary for
reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients
of the binaries. The source code files will usually contain a copy of
the license terms and acknowledge the authors.</p>
<p>Copyleft type licenses are a novel use of existing copyright law to
ensure a work remains freely available. The GNU General Public License
(GPL), originally written by Richard Stallman, was the first software
copyleft license to see extensive use, and continues to dominate in that
area. Creative Commons, a non-profit organization founded by Lawrence
Lessig, provides a similar license provision condition called
share-alike.</p>

<h2 id="cots"><a class="header" href="#cots">COTS</a></h2>
<p>Commercial off-the-shelf</p>
<p>Commercial off-the-shelf or commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS)
is a term used to describe the purchase of packaged solutions which are
then adapted to satisfy the needs of the purchasing organization, rather
than the commissioning of custom-made, or bespoke, solutions. A related
term, Mil-COTS, refers to COTS products for use by the U.S. military.</p>
<p>In the context of the U.S. government, the Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) has defined &quot;COTS&quot; as a formal term for commercial
items, including services, available in the commercial marketplace that
can be bought and used under government contract. For example, Microsoft
is a COTS software provider. Goods and construction materials may
qualify as COTS but bulk cargo does not. Services associated with the
commercial items may also qualify as COTS, including installation
services, training services, and cloud services.</p>
<p>COTS purchases are alternatives to custom software or one-off
developments -- government-funded developments or otherwise.</p>
<p>Although COTS products can be used out of the box, in practice the COTS
product must be configured to achieve the needs of the business and
integrated to existing organizational systems. Extending the
functionality of COTS products via custom development is also an option,
however this decision should be carefully considered due to the long
term support and maintenance implications. Such customized functionality
is not supported by the COTS vendor, so brings its own sets of issues
when upgrading the COTS product.</p>

<p>Carrier preselect is a term relating to the telecommunications industry.
It is a method of routing calls for least-cost routing (LCR) without the

<p>This is the process whereby a telephone subscriber whose telephone line
is maintained by one company, usually a former monopoly provider
(e.g. BT), can choose to have some of their calls automatically routed
across a different telephone company's network (e.g. Talk Talk) without
needing to enter a special code or special equipment.</p>
<h2 id="crc"><a class="header" href="#crc">CRC</a></h2>
<p>cyclic redundancy check</p>
<p>A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used
in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to
raw data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value
attached, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their
contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event
the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against
data corruption. CRCs can be used for error correction (see bitfilters).</p>
<p>CRCs are so called because the check (data verification) value is a
redundancy (it expands the message without adding information) and the
algorithm is based on cyclic codes. CRCs are popular because they are
simple to implement in binary hardware, easy to analyze mathematically,
and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by noise in
transmission channels. Because the check value has a fixed length, the
function that generates it is occasionally used as a hash function.</p>

<h2 id="cscf"><a class="header" href="#cscf">CSCF</a></h2>
<p>Call Session Control Function</p>
<p>Several roles of SIP servers or proxies, collectively called Call
Session Control Function (CSCF), are used to process SIP signaling
packets in the IMS.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is a SIP proxy that is the first point of
contact for the IMS terminal. It can be located either in the
visited network (in full IMS networks) or in the home network (when
the visited network is not IMS compliant yet). Some networks may use
a Session Border Controller (SBC) for this function. The P-CSCF is
at its core a specialized SBC for the User--network interface which
not only protects the network, but also the IMS terminal. The use of
an additional SBC between the IMS terminal and the P-CSCF is
unnecessary and infeasible due to the signaling being encrypted on
this leg. The terminal discovers its P-CSCF with either DHCP, or it
may be configured (e.g. during initial provisioning or via a 3GPP
IMS Management Object (MO)) or in the ISIM or assigned in the PDP
Context (in General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Interrogating-CSCF (I-CSCF) is another SIP function located at
the edge of an administrative domain. Its IP address is published in
the Domain Name System (DNS) of the domain (using NAPTR and SRV type
of DNS records), so that remote servers can find it, and use it as a
forwarding point (e.g., registering) for SIP packets to this domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Serving-CSCF (S-CSCF) is the central node of the signaling plane.
It is a SIP server, but performs session control too. It is always
located in the home network. It uses Diameter Cx and Dx interfaces
to the HSS to download user profiles and upload user-to-S-CSCF
associations (the user profile is only cached locally for processing
reasons and is not changed). All necessary subscriber profile
information is loaded from the HSS.</p>

<h2 id="csh"><a class="header" href="#csh">csh</a></h2>
<p>The C shell (csh or the improved version, tcsh) is a Unix shell created
by Bill Joy while he was a graduate student at University of California,
Berkeley in the late 1970s. It has been widely distributed, beginning
with the 2BSD release of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) that
Joy began distributing in 1978. Other early contributors to the ideas or
the code were Michael Ubell, Eric Allman, Mike O'Brien and Jim Kulp.</p>
<p>The C shell is a command processor typically run in a text window,
allowing the user to type commands. The C shell can also read commands
from a file, called a script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename
wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and
control structures for condition-testing and iteration. What
differentiated the C shell from others, especially in the 1980s, were
its interactive features and overall style. Its new features made it
easier and faster to use. The overall style of the language looked more
like C and was seen as more readable.</p>

<h2 id="csma"><a class="header" href="#csma">CSMA</a></h2>
<p>Carrier-sense multiple access</p>
<p>Carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) is a media access control (MAC)
protocol in which a node verifies the absence of other traffic before
transmitting on a shared transmission medium, such as an electrical bus
or a band of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>A transmitter attempts to determine whether another transmission is in
progress before initiating a transmission using a carrier-sense
mechanism. That is, it tries to detect the presence of a carrier signal
from another node before attempting to transmit. If a carrier is sensed,
the node waits for the transmission in progress to end before initiating
its own transmission. Using CSMA, multiple nodes may, in turn, send and
receive on the same medium. Transmissions by one node are generally
received by all other nodes connected to the medium.</p>
<p>Variations on basic CSMA include addition of collision-avoidance,
collision-detection and collision-resolution techniques.</p>
<h2 id="css"><a class="header" href="#css">CSS</a></h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and
reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
<p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has
rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
device.</p>
<p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>
<p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use
with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
validation service for CSS documents.</p>

<h2 id="cvsd"><a class="header" href="#cvsd">CVSD</a></h2>
<p>Continuously variable slope delta modulation</p>
<p>Continuously variable slope delta modulation (CVSD or CVSDM) is a voice
coding method. It is a delta modulation with variable step size (i.e.,
special case of adaptive delta modulation), first proposed by Greefkes
and Riemens in 1970.</p>
<p>CVSD encodes at 1 bit per sample, so that audio sampled at 16 kHz is
encoded at 16 kbit/s.</p>
<p>The encoder maintains a reference sample and a step size. Each input
sample is compared to the reference sample. If the input sample is
larger, the encoder emits a 1 bit and adds the step size to the
reference sample. If the input sample is smaller, the encoder emits a 0
bit and subtracts the step size from the reference sample. The encoder
also keeps the previous N bits of output (N = 3 or N = 4 are very
common) to determine adjustments to the step size; if the previous N
bits are all 1s or 0s, the step size is increased. Otherwise, the step
size is decreased (usually in an exponential manner, with
{<code>\displaystyle</code>{=tex}<code>\tau</code>{=tex}} <code>\tau</code>{=tex}being in the range of
5 ms). The step size is adjusted for every input sample processed.</p>
<p>To allow for bit errors to fade out and to allow (re)synchronization to
an ongoing bitstream, the output register (which keeps the reference
sample) is normally realized as a leaky integrator with a time constant
( {<code>\displaystyle</code>{=tex}<code>\tau</code>{=tex}} <code>\tau</code>{=tex}) of about 1 ms.</p>
<p>The decoder reverses this process, starting with the reference sample,
and adding or subtracting the step size according to the bit stream. The
sequence of adjusted reference samples are the reconstructed waveform,
and the step size is adjusted according to the same all-1s-or-0s logic
as in the encoder.</p>
<p>Adaptation of step size allows one to avoid slope overload (step of
quantization increases when the signal rapidly changes) and decreases
granular noise when the signal is constant (decrease of step of
quantisation).</p>
<p>CVSD is sometimes called a compromise between simplicity, low bitrate,
and quality. Common bitrates are 9.6--128 kbit/s.</p>
<p>Like other delta-modulation techniques, the output of the decoder does
not exactly match the original input to the encoder.</p>
