<p>Disciplined agile delivery (DAD) is a process decision framework that
enables simplified process decisions around incremental and iterative
solution delivery. DAD builds on the many practices espoused by
advocates of agile software development, including Scrum, agile
modeling, lean software development, and others.</p>
<p>The primary reference for disciplined agile delivery is the book of same
name, written by Scott Ambler and Mark Lines.</p>
<p>In particular, DAD has been identified as a means of moving beyond
Scrum. According to Cutter Senior Consultant Bhuvan Unhelkar, &quot;The DAD
framework provides a carefully constructed mechanism that not only
streamlines IT work, but more importantly, enables scaling.&quot; Paul Gorans
and Philippe Kruchten call for more discipline in implementation of
agile approaches and indicate that DAD, as an example framework, is &quot;a
hybrid agile approach to enterprise IT solution delivery that provides a
solid foundation from which to scale.</p>

<h2 id="dark-fibre"><a class="header" href="#dark-fibre">Dark Fibre</a></h2>
<p>A dark fibre or unlit fibre is an unused optical fibre, available for
use in fibre-optic communication.</p>
<p>The term dark fibre was originally used when referring to the potential
network capacity of telecommunication infrastructure, but now also
refers to the increasingly common practice of leasing fibre optic cables
from a network service provider, or, generally, to the fibre
installations not owned or controlled by traditional carriers. In common
vernacular, dark fibre may sometimes still be called &quot;dark&quot; if it has
been lit by a fibre lessee and not the cable's owner.</p>
<p>A dark fibre network or simply dark network is a privately operated
optical fiber network that is run directly by its operator over dark
fibre leased or purchased from another supplier. This is in contrast to
purchasing bandwidth or leased line capacity on an existing network.
Dark fibre networks may be used for private networking, or as Internet
access or infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="dass1"><a class="header" href="#dass1">DASS1</a></h2>
<p>Digital Access Signalling System 1 (DASS1) is a proprietary protocol
defined by British Telecom to provide ISDN services in the United
Kingdom. It is now obsolete, having been replaced by DASS2. This too
will become obsolete over the coming years as Q.931, a European
standard, becomes widely adopted in the EU.</p>
<h2 id="dass2"><a class="header" href="#dass2">DASS2</a></h2>
<p>Digital Access Signalling System 2 (DASS2) is an obsolescent protocol
defined by British Telecom for digital links to PSTN based on ISDN.
Although still available on request, it has been superseded by ETS 300
102 (&quot;EuroISDN&quot;).</p>
<p>DASS2 is an improved version over DASS1, based on experiences with
DPNSS.</p>
<p>In the UK, the ISDN concept was first introduced to customers by BT with
their DASS2 connections. DASS2 (Digital Access Signalling System) is a
BT-designed signalling standard, and was introduced before the Q.931
standard was finalised by the international community. British Telecom
used the term ISDN when describing their DASS2 lines.</p>
<p>DASS2 lines are provided to customers on a 2Mbit/s link and can handle
30 simultaneous calls (64kbit/s each). DASS2 is still offered by BT and
other UK carriers. Q.931 is the name of the CCITT document that
describes the agreed signalling format for International ISDN. CCITT had
previously been known as International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee. The organisation set out the internationally
agreed standards for telecommunications, and subsequently evolved into
the ITU. In the United Kingdom, the Q.931-based protocol is ETS 300 102
(also known as EuroISDN). This is a very close implementation of the
original CCITT specification. It is a 2Mbit/s service as with DASS2, but
the feature capability is far greater and has negated the problems
associated with DASS2, including echo problems and circuit spikes. In
the UK, both DASS 2 and EuroISDN (ETS 300 102) lines are available to
customers with EuroISDN as the preferred signalling type. Customers
normally choose the desired signalling system, as this will be dictated
by their CPE (Customer Premises Equipment), usually a PABX.</p>
<p>Most modern PABXs can handle many different types of signalling system,
however the trend seems to be away from the DASS2 (which is no longer
being developed by BT and has been known to deny problems with their
DASS2 circuits), and towards the internationally recognised Q.931
standard, which is utilised by many country's telephony service
providers.</p>
<p>The CCITT specify the standards for the layers 1, 2 and 3 signalling
messages. The layer 3 messages are the messages which actually control
the call setup, teardown, and routing.</p>
<p>The layer 3 messages or call control messages are the minimum messages
that must be understood by the interfacing equipment. Individual service
providers may publish their own documentation which details further
messages that will be transported in addition to Q.931 messages. There
are a number of additional European documents that cover supplementary
services. These cover features that may be instigated by exchanges via
the ISDN and require a higher degree of layer 3 implementation.</p>

<p>In computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise
data warehouse (EDW), is a system used for reporting and data analysis,
and is considered a core component of business intelligence. DWs are
central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate
sources. They store current and historical data in one single place7that
are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the
enterprise.</p>
<p>The data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational
systems (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an
operational data store and may require data cleansing for additional
operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the DW for
reporting.</p>

<h2 id="ddos"><a class="header" href="#ddos">DDOS</a></h2>
<p>Distributed Denial of Service</p>
<p>In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack
in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource
unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely
disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of
service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or
resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and
prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.[1]</p>
<p>In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming
traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This
effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a
single source.</p>
<p>A DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the
entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter,
disrupting trade.</p>

<p>DER is a subset of BER providing for exactly one way to encode an ASN.1
value. DER is intended for situations when a unique encoding is needed,
such as in cryptography, and ensures that a data structure that needs to
be digitally signed produces a unique serialized representation. DER can
be considered a canonical form of BER. For example, in BER
a Boolean value of true can be encoded as any of 255 non-zero byte
values, while in DER there is one way to encode a Boolean value of true.</p>
<p>The most significant DER encoding constraints are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Length encoding must use the definite form</p>
<ol>
<li>Additionally, the shortest possible length encoding must be used</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bitstring, octetstring, and restricted character strings must use
the primitive encoding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elements of a Set are encoded in sorted order, based on their tag
value<br />
DER is widely used for digital certificates such as X.509.</p>

<h2 id="des"><a class="header" href="#des">DES</a></h2>
<p>Data Encryption Standard</p>
<p>The Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the
encryption of electronic data. Although insecure, it was highly
influential in the advancement of modern cryptography.</p>
<p>Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by
Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of
Standards (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate
for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government
data. In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency
(NSA), the NBS eventually selected a slightly modified version
(strengthened against differential cryptanalysis, but weakened against
brute-force attacks), which was published as an official Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.</p>
<p>The publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard simultaneously
resulted in its quick international adoption and widespread academic
scrutiny. Controversies arose out of classified design elements, a
relatively short key length of the symmetric-key block cipher design,
and the involvement of the NSA, nourishing suspicions about a backdoor.
Today it is known that the S-boxes that had raised those suspicions were
in fact designed by the NSA to actually remove a backdoor they secretly
knew (differential cryptanalysis). However, the NSA also ensured that
the key size was drastically reduced such that they could break it by
brute force attack. The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received
over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their
cryptanalysis.</p>
<p>DES is insecure. This is mainly due to the 56-bit key size being too
small. In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15
minutes (see chronology). There are also some analytical results which
demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are
infeasible to mount in practice. The algorithm is believed to be
practically secure in the form of Triple DES, although there are
theoretical attacks. This cipher has been superseded by the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES). Furthermore, DES has been withdrawn as a
standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<br />

<p>In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general,
reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context
in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed
directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template
for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different
situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the
programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an
application or system.</p>
<p>Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and
interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final
application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply
mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages, some
patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in
support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and
object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for
non-object-oriented languages.</p>
<p>Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer
programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm
and a concrete algorithm.</p>

access only what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the
organization's network is firewalled. The DMZ functions as a small,
isolated network positioned between the Internet and the private network
and, if its design is effective, allows the organization extra time to
detect and address breaches before they would further penetrate into the
internal networks.<br />

<p>Domain Name System</p>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming
system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
Internet or a private network. It associates various information with
domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most
prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the
numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer
services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing
a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an
essential component of the functionality on the Internet, that has been
in use since 1985.</p>

<h2 id="domain-name"><a class="header" href="#domain-name">Domain Name</a></h2>
<p>A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of
administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet.
Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name
System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain
names are used in various networking contexts and for
application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a
domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a
personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting
a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via
the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.</p>
<p>Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS
root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are
the top-level domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains
(gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and
the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Below these top-level
domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain
names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to
connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly
accessible Internet resources or run web sites.</p>
<p>The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain
name registrars who sell their services to the public.</p>
<p>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely
specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts
omitted. Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may
therefore be written in any desired capitalization method, but most
commonly domain names are written in lowercase in technical contexts.<br />
<img src="./images/D/15008007.png?width=350" alt="" /></p>
<p>Domain name space<br />
Today, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
manages the top-level development and architecture of the Internet
domain name space. It authorizes domain name registrars, through which
domain names may be registered and reassigned.</p>
<p>The hierarchical domain name system, organized into zones, each served
by domain name servers.<br />
The domain name space consists of a tree of domain names. Each node in
the tree holds information associated with the domain name. The tree
sub-divides into zones beginning at the DNS root zone.<br />

<h2 id="dot1q"><a class="header" href="#dot1q">Dot1Q</a></h2>
<p>IEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q</p>
<p>IEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q, is the networking standard that
supports virtual LANs (VLANs) on an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network. The
standard defines a system of VLAN tagging for Ethernet frames and the
accompanying procedures to be used by bridges and switches in handling
such frames. The standard also contains provisions for a
quality-of-service prioritization scheme commonly known as IEEE 802.1p
and defines the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol.</p>
<p>Portions of the network which are VLAN-aware (i.e., IEEE 802.1Q
conformant) can include VLAN tags. When a frame enters the VLAN-aware
portion of the network, a tag is added to represent the VLAN
membership.[a] Each frame must be distinguishable as being within
exactly one VLAN. A frame in the VLAN-aware portion of the network that
does not contain a VLAN tag is assumed to be flowing on the native VLAN.</p>
<h2 id="dot1q-trunking"><a class="header" href="#dot1q-trunking">Dot1Q trunking</a></h2>
<p>A simple view for dot1q (802.1q) trunking:<br />
For ease of understanding the Dot1q (802.1q) trunking between switches
can be seen as pipes (VLANs) inside a main pipe (Trunk) to connect VLANs
that are being distributed on different switches.<br />
<img src="./images/D/15008019.png?width=448" alt="" /><br />
So if that makes sense then a better representation is that packets are
tagged as they go into the trunk link, like below.<br />
The packets are tagged with the VLAN ID, that the port they are received
on is configured with. When they are received on the other end they are
then sent to the appropriate VLAN ports.<br />
<img src="./images/D/15008025.png?width=448" alt="" /><br />
So how does the switch know which ports to send the packet to, the
switches are assigned with the VLAN number.<br />

<p>In a telecommunications network or computer network, downstream refers

<p>Although the best dial-up modems are called 56 kbit/s modems, downstream
speeds can be limited to a few tens of kilobits per second with even
lower upstream speeds. Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and
cable modems, two popular Internet access technologies, greatly improved
downstream speeds reaching several Mbit/s. Mobile broadband and
satellite Internet access providers also often have lower upstream
speeds than downstream.</p>
<p>One process sending data primarily in the downstream direction is
downloading. However, the overall download speed depends on the
downstream speed of the user, the upstream speed of the server, and the
network between them.</p>

<p>Deep Packet Inspection</p>
<p>Deep packet inspection (DPI) is a type of data processing that inspects
in detail the data being sent over a computer network, and usually takes
action by blocking, re-routing, or logging it accordingly. Deep packet
inspection is often used to ensure that data is in the correct format,
to check for malicious code, eavesdropping and internet censorship[1]
among other purposes. There are multiple headers for IP packets; network
equipment only needs to use the first of these (the IP header) for
normal operation, but use of the second header (such as TCP or UDP) is
normally considered to be shallow packet inspection (usually called
stateful packet inspection) despite this definition.[2]</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to acquire packets for deep packet inspection.
Using port mirroring (sometimes called Span Port) is a very common way,
as well as an optical splitter.</p>
<p>Deep Packet Inspection (and filtering) enables advanced network
management, user service, and security functions as well as internet
data mining, eavesdropping, and internet censorship. Although DPI has
been used for Internet management for many years, some advocates of net
neutrality fear that the technique may be used anticompetitively or to
reduce the openness of the Internet.[3]</p>
<p>DPI is used in a wide range of applications, at the so-called
&quot;enterprise&quot; level (corporations and larger institutions), in
telecommunications service providers, and in governments.</p>

<p>Digital Terrestrial TV</p>
<p>Digital terrestrial television (DTTV or DTT) is a technology for

stations broadcast television content by radio waves to televisions in
consumers' residences in a digital format. DTTV is a major technological
advance over the previous analog television, and has largely replaced
analog which had been in common use since the middle of the last
century. Test broadcasts began in 1998 with the changeover to DTTV (aka
Analog Switchoff (ASO) or Digital Switchover (DSO)) beginning in 2006
and is now complete in many countries. The advantages of digital
terrestrial television are similar to those obtained by digitising
platforms such as cable TV, satellite, and telecommunications: more
efficient use of limited radio spectrum bandwidth, provision of more
television channels than analog, better quality images, and potentially
lower operating costs for broadcasters (after the initial upgrade
costs).</p>
<h2 id="dtv"><a class="header" href="#dtv">DTV</a></h2>
<p>Digital TV</p>
<p>Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of television signals,
including the sound channel, using digital encoding, in contrast to the
earlier television technology, analog television, in which the video and
audio are carried by analog signals. It is an innovative advance that
represents the first significant evolution in television technology
since color television in the 1950s. Digital TV makes more economical
use of scarce radio spectrum space; it can transmit multiple channels in
the same bandwidth occupied by a single channel of analog television,
and provides many new features that analog television cannot. A
switchover from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2006 in some
countries, and many industrial countries have now completed the
changeover, while other countries are in various stages of adaptation.
Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in
different parts of the world</p>

<p>Dynamically Verified Static Routing</p>
<p>Dynamically Verified Static Routing (DVSR) is a proprietary routing
protocol of the former Redback (now Ericsson) available on SmartEdge and
Smart Services Router products.</p>
<p>DVSR can be defined as a semi-dynamic and semi-static routing protocol.</p>
<p>A DVSR route is based on static routing principle, but the router
regularly checks for the next hop availability before the prefix can be
injected into the local routing table and redistributed towards other
routing tables. The DVSR route configuration allows the setup of success
and failure counters used to declare the route as active or not. It
could be described as a number of DVSR router attempts to ping the next
hop; in case of a given number of successful replies the route is added
to the local routing table or, after a set number of consecutive
failures, the route is withdrawn.</p>
<p>SmartEdge routers support DVSR as a unique edge routing feature in
addition to static routing and regular IGPs, such as IS-IS, OSPF, and
RIP. DVSR is similar to normal static routing. The main difference is
that the DVSR's next hop, or some other relevant host IP address, is
dynamically verified by this protocol before the prefix can be injected
into the local routing table. In many ISP networks, using static routing
without proper next-hop checks results in black holing of network
traffic.</p>
