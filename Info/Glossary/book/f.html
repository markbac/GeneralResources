<p>Frame Check Sequence</p>
<p>A frame check sequence (FCS) refers to the extra error-detecting code
added to a frame in a communications protocol. Frames are used to send
upper-layer data and ultimately the application data from a source to a
destination.</p>
<p>The detection does not imply error recovery; for example, Ethernet
specifies that a damaged frame should be discarded, but at the same time
does not specify any action to cause the frame to be retransmitted.
Other protocols, notably the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), can
notice the data loss and initiate error recovery.</p>
<h2 id="fddi"><a class="header" href="#fddi">FDDI</a></h2>
<p>Fiber Distributed Data Interface</p>
<p>Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a standard for data
transmission in a local area network. It uses optical fiber as its
standard underlying physical medium, although it was also later
specified to use copper cable, in which case it may be called CDDI
(Copper Distributed Data Interface), standardized as TP-PMD
(Twisted-Pair Physical Medium-Dependent), also referred to as TP-DDI
(Twisted-Pair Distributed Data Interface).</p>
<p>FDDI was effectively made obsolete in local networks by Fast Ethernet
which offered the same 100 Mbit/s speeds, but at a much lower cost and,
since 1998, by Gigabit Ethernet due to its speed, and even lower cost,
and ubiquity.</p>

<p>In telecommunications, a femtocell is a small, low-power cellular base
station, typically designed for use in a home or small business. A
broader term which is more widespread in the industry is small cell,
with femtocell as a subset. It is also called femto AccessPoint (AP). It
connects to the service provider's network via broadband (such as DSL or
cable); current designs typically support four to eight simultaneously
active mobile phones in a residential setting depending on version
number and femtocell hardware, and eight to sixteen mobile phones in
enterprise settings. A femtocell allows service providers to extend
service coverage indoors or at the cell edge, especially where access
would otherwise be limited or unavailable. Although much attention is
focused on WCDMA, the concept is applicable to all standards, including
GSM, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA, WiMAX and LTE solutions.<br />

<h2 id="fips"><a class="header" href="#fips">FIPS</a></h2>
<p>Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are publicly announced
standards developed by the United States federal government for use in
computer systems by non-military government agencies and government
contractors.</p>
<p>FIPS standards are issued to establish requirements for various purposes
such as ensuring computer security and interoperability, and are
intended for cases in which suitable industry standards do not already
exist. Many FIPS specifications are modified versions of standards used
in the technical communities, such as the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
<h2 id="fips-140-2"><a class="header" href="#fips-140-2">FIPS 140-2</a></h2>
<p>The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2,
(FIPS PUB 140-2), is a U.S. government computer security standard used
to approve cryptographic modules. The title is Security
Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. Initial publication was on May
25, 2001 and was last updated December 3, 2002</p>
<p>Purpose<br />
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued the
FIPS 140 Publication Series to coordinate the requirements and
standards for cryptography modules that include both hardware and
software components. Protection of a cryptographic module within a
security system is necessary to maintain the confidentiality and
integrity of the information protected by the module. This standard
specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a
cryptographic module. The standard provides four increasing, qualitative
levels of security intended to cover a wide range of potential
applications and environments. The security requirements cover areas
related to the secure design and implementation of a cryptographic
module. These areas include cryptographic module specification;
cryptographic module ports and interfaces; roles, services, and
authentication; finite state model; physical security; operational
environment; cryptographic key management; electromagnetic
interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC); self-tests; design
assurance; and mitigation of other attacks.</p>
<p>Federal agencies and departments can validate that the module in use is
covered by an existing FIPS 140-1 or FIPS 140-2 certificate that
specifies the exact module name, hardware, software, firmware, and/or
applet version numbers. The cryptographic modules are produced by
the private sector or open source communities for use by the U.S.
government and other regulated industries (such as financial and
health-care institutions) that collect, store, transfer, share and
disseminate sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. A commercial
cryptographic module is also commonly referred to as a hardware security
module (HSM).</p>
<p>Security levels<br />
FIPS 140-2 defines four levels of security, simply named &quot;Level 1&quot; to
&quot;Level 4&quot;. It does not specify in detail what level of security is
required by any particular application.</p>
<p>Level 1<br />
Security Level 1 provides the lowest level of security. Basic security
requirements are specified for a cryptographic module (e.g., at least
one Approved algorithm or Approved security function shall be used). No
specific physical security mechanisms are required in a Security Level 1
cryptographic module beyond the basic requirement for production-grade
components. An example of a Security Level 1 cryptographic module is a
personal computer (PC) encryption board.</p>
<p>Level 2<br />
Security Level 2 improves upon the physical security mechanisms of a
Security Level 1 cryptographic module by requiring features that show
evidence of tampering, including tamper-evident coatings or seals that
must be broken to attain physical access to the plaintext cryptographic
keys and critical security parameters (CSPs) within the module, or
pick-resistant locks on covers or doors to protect against unauthorized
physical access.</p>
<p>Level 3<br />
In addition to the tamper-evident physical security mechanisms required
at Security Level 2, Security Level 3 attempts to prevent the intruder
from gaining access to CSPs held within the cryptographic module.
Physical security mechanisms required at Security Level 3 are intended
to have a high probability of detecting and responding to attempts at
physical access, use or modification of the cryptographic module. The
physical security mechanisms may include the use of strong enclosures
and tamper-detection/response circuitry that zeroes all plaintext CSPs
when the removable covers/doors of the cryptographic module are opened.</p>
<p>Level 4<br />
Security Level 4 provides the highest level of security. At this
security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete
envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent
of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical
access. Penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure from any
direction has a very high probability of being detected, resulting in
the immediate deletion of all plaintext CSPs.</p>
<p>Security Level 4 cryptographic modules are useful for operation in
physically unprotected environments. Security Level 4 also protects a
cryptographic module against a security compromise due to environmental
conditions or fluctuations outside of the module's normal operating
ranges for voltage and temperature. Intentional excursions beyond the
normal operating ranges may be used by an attacker to thwart a
cryptographic module's defenses. A cryptographic module is required to
either include special environmental protection features designed to
detect fluctuations and delete CSPs, or to undergo rigorous
environmental failure testing to provide a reasonable assurance that the
module will not be affected by fluctuations outside of the normal
operating range in a manner that can compromise the security of the
module.</p>
<h2 id="firewall"><a class="header" href="#firewall">Firewall</a></h2>
<p>n computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and
controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined
security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a
trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the
Internet.</p>
<p>Firewalls are often categorized as either network firewalls or
host-based firewalls. Network firewalls filter traffic between two or
more networks and run on network hardware. Host-based firewalls run on
host computers and control network traffic in and out of those
machines.<br />

<h2 id="fortran"><a class="header" href="#fortran">Fortran</a></h2>
<p>Fortran is a general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language
that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific
computing.</p>
<p>Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering
applications, FORTRAN came to dominate this area of programming early on
and has been in continuous use for over half a century in
computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction,
finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational
physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular
language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that
benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.</p>
<p>Fortran encompasses a lineage of versions, each of which evolved to add
extensions to the language while usually retaining compatibility with
prior versions. Successive versions have added support for structured
programming and processing of character-based data (FORTRAN 77), array
programming, modular programming and generic programming (Fortran 90),
high performance Fortran (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming
(Fortran 2003) and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).</p>
<p>Fortran's design was the basis for many other programming languages.
Among the better known is BASIC, which is a based on FORTRAN II with a
number of syntax cleanups, notably better logical structures, and other
changes to more easily work in an interactive environment.</p>

<h2 id="fqdn"><a class="header" href="#fqdn">FQDN</a></h2>
<p>Fully Qualified Domain Name</p>
<p>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an
absolute domain name, is a domain name that specifies its exact location
in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all
domain levels, including at least a second-level domain and a top-level
domain. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of
ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way.</p>
<p>The DNS root domain is unnamed which is expressed by having an empty
label in the DNS hierarchy, resulting in a fully qualified domain name
ending with the top-level domain. However, in some cases the full stop
(period) character is required at the end of the fully qualified domain
name.</p>
<p>In contrast to a domain name that is fully specified, a domain name that

<h2 id="frame-relay"><a class="header" href="#frame-relay">Frame Relay</a></h2>
<p>Frame Relay is a standardized wide area network technology that
specifies the physical and data link layers of digital
telecommunications channels using a packet switching methodology.
Originally designed for transport across Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) infrastructure, it may be used today in the context of
many other network interfaces.</p>
<p>Network providers commonly implement Frame Relay for voice (VoFR) and
data as an encapsulation technique used between local area networks
(LANs) over a wide area network (WAN). Each end-user gets a private line
(or leased line) to a Frame Relay node. The Frame Relay network handles
the transmission over a frequently changing path transparent to all
end-user extensively used WAN protocols. It is less expensive than
leased lines and that is one reason for its popularity. The extreme
simplicity of configuring user equipment in a Frame Relay network offers
another reason for Frame Relay's popularity.</p>

<h2 id="fsk"><a class="header" href="#fsk">FSK</a></h2>
<p>Frequency-shift keying (FSK) is a frequency modulation scheme in which
digital information is transmitted through discrete frequency changes of
a carrier signal. The technology is used for communication systems such
as amateur radio, caller ID and emergency broadcasts. The simplest FSK
is binary FSK (BFSK). BFSK uses a pair of discrete frequencies to
transmit binary (0s and 1s) information. With this scheme, the &quot;1&quot; is
called the mark frequency and the &quot;0&quot; is called the space frequency.<br />

<h2 id="ftp"><a class="header" href="#ftp">FTP</a></h2>
<p>File Transfer Protocol</p>
<p>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for
the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer
network.</p>
<p>FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate
control and data connections between the client and the server.</p>
<h2 id="ftps"><a class="header" href="#ftps">FTPS</a></h2>
<p>File Transfer Protocol Secure</p>
<p>FTPS (also known as FTPES, FTP-SSL, and FTP Secure) is an extension to
the commonly used File Transfer Protocol (FTP) that adds support for the
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
cryptographic protocols.</p>
<p>FTPS should not be confused with the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP),
a secure file transfer subsystem for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol it
is not compatible with. It is also different from FTP over SSH, the
practice of tunneling FTP through an SSH connection.</p>
<h2 id="full-duplex"><a class="header" href="#full-duplex">Full duplex</a></h2>
<p>In a full-duplex system, both parties can communicate with each other
simultaneously. An example of a full-duplex device is a telephone; the
parties at both ends of a call can speak and be heard by the other party
simultaneously. The earphone reproduces the speech of the remote party
as the microphone transmits the speech of the local party, because there
is a two-way communication channel between them, or more strictly
speaking, because there are two communication channels between them.</p>
<h2 id="function-point"><a class="header" href="#function-point">Function Point</a></h2>
<p>Size measure for a software system based on abstracted measure of system
functionality.</p>
<h2 id="functional-requirement"><a class="header" href="#functional-requirement">Functional Requirement</a></h2>
<p>Functionality that must be built into the system to satisfy the business
requirements. Also known as a <em>what requirement.</em></p>
<h2 id="functional-testing"><a class="header" href="#functional-testing">Functional Testing</a></h2>
<p>Comparing a system's behavior against expected behavior, without concern
for the internal workings of the system.</p>
<h2 id="fuzzy-front-end"><a class="header" href="#fuzzy-front-end">Fuzzy Front End</a></h2>
<p>Term coined by Steve McConnell to describes the initial inception phases
of a project. CxOne defines the start of the fuzzy front end as the
point someone starts thinking about a project and working on chartering
it, and the end as the point at which the charter is approved and the
project begins.</p>
<h2 id="fuzzy-logic"><a class="header" href="#fuzzy-logic">Fuzzy Logic</a></h2>
<p>A relative ranking technique for describing characteristics. Often used
in conjunction with items that contain uncertainty, like estimates. A
general example is to take three buckets called small, medium, and
large. Items are assigned t each bucket, and then the bucket values are
used as stand-ins for a possible range of quantitative values. One
common characteristic of fuzzy logic buckets is that the high end value
from one bucket overlaps the low end value of the next bucket.</p>
<h2 id="fxo"><a class="header" href="#fxo">FXO</a></h2>
<p>Foreign Exchange Office</p>
<p>FXS (Foreign Exchange Station) means the wall jack or the interface to
the telephone system which FXO devices can be connected to. Using these
interfaces a call can be established. The port provides the necessary
electricity as well as the dialtone and the call signal.<br />

<h2 id="fxs"><a class="header" href="#fxs">FXS</a></h2>
<p>Foreign Exchange Station</p>
<p>FXO (Foreign Exchange Office) is the port that receives the analog line
on the telephone or fax machine. It establishes the connection to the
analog line (FXS). FXS devices connected to phone system are referred to
as endpoints (e.g. a phone).<br />
