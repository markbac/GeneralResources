<h2 id="g711"><a class="header" href="#g711">G.711</a></h2>
<p>G.711 is an ITU-T standard for audio companding. It is primarily used in
telephony. The standard was released for usage in 1972. Its formal name
is Pulse code modulation (PCM) of voice frequencies. It is a required
standard in many technologies, for example in H.320 and H.323
specifications. It can also be used for fax communication over IP
networks (as defined in T.38 specification). G.711, also known as Pulse
Code Modulation (PCM), is a very commonly used waveform codec. G.711 is
a narrowband audio codec that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s.
G.711 passes audio signals in the range of 300--3400 Hz and samples them
at the rate of 8,000 samples per second, with the tolerance on that rate
of 50 parts per million (ppm). Non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization
with 8 bits is used to represent each sample, resulting in a 64 kbit/s
bit rate. There are two slightly different versions: μ-law, which is
used primarily in North America and Japan, and A-law, which is in use in
most other countries outside North America.</p>
<p>Two enhancements to G.711 have been published: G.711.0 utilizes lossless
data compression to reduce the bandwidth usage and G.711.1 increases
audio quality by increasing bandwidth.</p>
<p>Types<br />
G.711 defines two main companding algorithms, the µ-law algorithm and
A-law algorithm. Both are logarithmic, but A-law was specifically
designed to be simpler for a computer to process. The standard also
defines a sequence of repeating code values which defines the power
level of 0 dB.</p>
<p>The µ-law and A-law algorithms encode 14-bit and 13-bit signed linear
PCM samples (respectively) to logarithmic 8-bit samples. Thus, the G.711
encoder will create a 64 kbit/s bitstream for a signal sampled at 8 kHz.</p>
<p>G.711 μ-law tends to give more resolution to higher range signals while
G.711 A-law provides more quantization levels at lower signal levels.<br />

<h2 id="g7111"><a class="header" href="#g7111">G.711.1</a></h2>
<p>G.711.1 is an extension to G.711, published as ITU-T Recommendation
G.711.1 in March 2008. Its formal name is Wideband embedded extension
for G.711 pulse code modulation.</p>
<p>G.711.1, allows the addition of narrowband and/or wideband (16000
samples/s) enhancements, each at 25% of the bitrate of the (included)
base G.711 bitstream, leading to data rates of 64, 80 or 96 kbit/s.</p>
<p>G.711.1 is compatible with G.711 at 64 kbit/s, hence an efficient
deployment in existing G.711-based voice over IP (VoIP) infrastructures
is foreseen. The G.711.1 coder can encode signals at 16 kHz with a
bandwidth of 50--7000 Hz at 80 and 96 kbit/s, and for 8-kHz sampling the
output may produce signals with a bandwidth ranging from 50 up to 4000
Hz, operating at 64 and 80 kbit/s.</p>
<p>The G.711.1 encoder creates an embedded bitstream structured in three
layers corresponding to three available bit rates: 64, 80 and 96 kbit/s.
The bitstream does not contain any information on which layers are
contained, an implementation would require outband signalling on which
layers are available. The three G.711.1 layers are: log companded pulse
code modulation (PCM) of the lower band including noise feedback,
embedded PCM extension with adaptive bit allocation for enhancing the
quality of the base layer in the lower band, and weighted vector
quantization coding of the higher band based on modified discrete cosine
transformation (MDCT).</p>
<p>Two extensions for G.711.1 are planned in 2010: superwideband extension
(bandwidth to 14000 Hz) and lossless bitstream compression.</p>
<h2 id="g719"><a class="header" href="#g719">G.719</a></h2>
<p>G.719 is an ITU-T standard audio coding format providing high quality,
moderate bit rate (32 to 128 kbit/s) wideband (20 Hz - 20 kHz audio
bandwidth, 48 kHz audio sample rate) audio coding at low computational
load. It was produced through a collaboration between Polycom and
Ericsson.</p>
<p>G.719 incorporates elements of Polycom's Siren22 codec (22 kHz) and
Ericsson codec technology, as well as Polycom's Siren7 and Siren14
codecs (G.722.1 and G.722.1 Annex C), which have been used in
videoconferencing systems for many years. As ITU-T Recommendation G.719,
it was approved on June 13, 2008.</p>
<p>G.719 is optimized for both speech and music. It is based on transform
coding with adaptive time-resolution, adaptive bit-allocation and low
complexity lattice vector quantization. The computational complexity is
quite low (18 floating-point MIPS) for an efficient high-quality
compressor. The codec operates on 20 ms frames, and the algorithmic
delay end-to-end is 40 ms. The encoder input and decoder output are
sampled at 48 kHz.</p>
<p>In addition to the nominal bit rates of 32, 48 and 64 kbit/s, the G.719
codec has an inherent feature of flexible rate selection. In fact, it is
possible to accommodate any rate between 32 kbit/s and 64 kbit/s by
steps of 4 kbit/s. Moreover, the codec can also provide higher rates
than 64 kbit/s and up to 128 kbit/s.</p>
<h2 id="g722"><a class="header" href="#g722">G.722</a></h2>
<p>G.722 is an ITU-T standard 7 kHz Wideband audio codec operating at 48,
56 and 64 kbit/s. It was approved by ITU-T in November 1988. Technology
of the codec is based on sub-band ADPCM (SB-ADPCM).</p>
<p>G722 provides improved speech quality due to a wider speech bandwidth of
50--7000 Hz compared to narrowband speech coders like G.711 which in
general are optimized for POTS wireline quality of 300--3400 Hz. G.722
sample audio data at a rate of 16 kHz (using 14 bits), double that of
traditional telephony interfaces, which results in superior audio
quality and clarity.[2]</p>
<p>Other ITU-T 7 kHz wideband codecs include G.722.1 and G.722.2. These
codecs are not variants of G.722 and they use different patented
compression technologies. G.722.1 is based on Siren codecs and offers
lower bit-rate compressions (24 kbit/s or 32 kbit/s). A more recent
G.722.2, also known as AMR-WB (&quot;Adaptive Multirate Wideband&quot;) is based
on ACELP and offers even lower bit-rate compressions (6.6 kbit/s to
23.85 kbit/s), as well as the ability to quickly adapt to varying
compressions as the network topography mutates. In the latter case,
bandwidth is automatically conserved when network congestion is high.
When congestion returns to a normal level, a lower-compression,
higher-quality bitrate is restored.<br />

<h2 id="g7231"><a class="header" href="#g7231">G.723.1</a></h2>
<p>G.723.1 is an audio codec for voice that compresses voice audio in 30 ms
frames. An algorithmic look-ahead of 7.5 ms duration means that total
algorithmic delay is 37.5 ms. Its official name is Dual rate speech
coder for multimedia communications transmitting at 5.3 and 6.3 kbit/s.
It is sometimes associated with a Truespeech trademark in coprocessors
produced by DSP Group.[1]</p>
<p>This is a completely different codec from G.723.</p>
<p>There are two bit rates at which G.723.1 can operate:</p>
<p>6.3 kbit/s (using 24 byte frames) using a MPC-MLQ algorithm (MOS 3.9)<br />
5.3 kbit/s (using 20 byte frames) using an ACELP algorithm (MOS 3.62)</p>
<h2 id="g726"><a class="header" href="#g726">G.726</a></h2>
<p>G.726 is an ITU-T ADPCM speech codec standard covering the transmission
of voice at rates of 16, 24, 32, and 40 kbit/s. It was introduced to
supersede both G.721, which covered ADPCM at 32 kbit/s, and G.723, which
described ADPCM for 24 and 40 kbit/s. G.726 also introduced a new 16
kbit/s rate. The four bit rates associated with G.726 are often referred
to by the bit size of a sample, which are 2, 3, 4, and 5-bits
respectively.</p>
<p>The most commonly used mode is 32 kbit/s, which doubles the usable
network capacity by using half the rate of G.711. It is primarily used
on international trunks in the phone network and is the standard codec
used in DECT wireless phone systems. The principal application of 24 and
16 kbit/s channels is for overload channels carrying voice in digital
circuit multiplication equipment (DCME). The principal application of 40
kbit/s channels is to carry data modem signals in DCME, especially for
modems operating at greater than 4800 bit/s.</p>

<h2 id="gfast"><a class="header" href="#gfast">G.Fast</a></h2>
<p>G.fast is a digital subscriber line (DSL) protocol standard for local
loops shorter than 500 m, with performance targets between 100 Mbit/s
and 1 Gbit/s, depending on loop length. High speeds are only achieved
over very short loops. Although G.fast was initially designed for loops
shorter than 250 meters, Sckipio in early 2015 demonstrated G.fast
delivering speeds over 100 Mbit/s nearly 500 meters and the EU announced
a research project.[</p>
<p>Formal specifications have been published as ITU-T G.9700 and G.9701,
with approval of G.9700 granted in April 2014 and approval of G.9701
granted on December 5, 2014. Development was coordinated with the
Broadband Forum's FTTdp (fiber to the distribution point) project.</p>
<p>The letter G in G.fast stands for the ITU-T G series of recommendations;
fast is an acronym for fast access to subscriber terminals. Limited
demonstration hardware was demonstrated in mid-2013. The first chipsets
were introduced in October 2014, with commercial hardware introduced in
2015, and first deployments started in 2016.<br />

<p>Government Communications Headquarters</p>
<p>The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) is an intelligence and
security organisation responsible for providing signals intelligence
(SIGINT) and information assurance to the government and armed forces of
the United Kingdom. Based in &quot;The Doughnut&quot; in the suburbs of
Cheltenham, GCHQ is the responsibility of the country's Secretary of
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, but it is not a part of the
Foreign Office and its director ranks as a Permanent Secretary.</p>
<p>GCHQ was originally established after the First World War as the
Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) and was known under that name
until 1946. During the Second World War it was located at Bletchley
Park, where it was responsible for breaking of the German Enigma codes.
Currently there are two main components of the GCHQ, the Composite
Signals Organisation (CSO), which is responsible for gathering
information, and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is
responsible for securing the UK's own communications. The Joint
Technical Language Service (JTLS) is a small department and
cross-government resource responsible for mainly technical language
support and translation and interpreting services across government
departments. It is co-located with GCHQ for administrative purposes.</p>

<h2 id="geran"><a class="header" href="#geran">GERAN</a></h2>
<p>GERAN is an abbreviation for GSM EDGE Radio Access Network. The
standards for GERAN are maintained by the 3GPP (Third Generation
Partnership Project). GERAN is a key part of GSM, and also of combined
UMTS/GSM networks.</p>
<p>GERAN is the radio part of GSM/EDGE together with the network that joins
the base stations (the Ater and Abis interfaces) and the base station
controllers (A interfaces, etc.) The network represents the core of a
GSM network, through which phone calls and packet data are routed from
and to the PSTN and Internet to and from subscriber handsets. A mobile
phone operator's network comprises one or more GERANs, coupled with
UTRANs in the case of a UMTS/GSM network.</p>
<p>A GERAN without EDGE is a GRAN, but is otherwise identical in concept.</p>
<p>A GERAN without GSM is an ERAN.<br />

<h2 id="ggsn"><a class="header" href="#ggsn">GGSN</a></h2>
<p>Gateway GPRS support node</p>
<p>The gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) is a main component of the GPRS
network. The GGSN is responsible for the internetworking between the
GPRS network and external packet switched networks, such as the Internet
or an X.25 network.</p>
<p>From an external network's point of view, the GGSN is a router to a
&quot;sub-network&quot;, because the GGSN 'hides' the GPRS infrastructure from the
external network. When the GGSN receives data addressed to a specific
user, it checks if the user is active. If it is, the GGSN forwards the
data to the SGSN serving the mobile user, but if the mobile user is
inactive, the data is discarded. In the other direction,
mobile-originated packets are routed to the right network by the GGSN.</p>
<p>The GGSN is the anchor point that enables the mobility of the user
terminal in the GPRS/UMTS networks. In essence, it carries out the role
in GPRS equivalent to the home agent in Mobile IP. It maintains routing
necessary to tunnel the protocol data units (PDUs) to the SGSN that
services a particular MS (mobile station).</p>
<p>The GGSN converts the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN into the
appropriate packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or X.25) and
sends them out on the corresponding packet data network. In the other
direction, PDP addresses of incoming data packets are converted to the
GSM address of the destination user. The readdressed packets are sent to
the responsible SGSN. For this purpose, the GGSN stores the current SGSN
address of the user and his or her profile in its location register. The
GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router
for the connected user equipment (UE). The GGSN also performs
authentication and charging functions.</p>
<p>Other functions include subscriber screening, IP pool management and
address mapping, QoS and PDP context enforcement.</p>
<p>With LTE scenario the GGSN functionality moves to SAE gateway (with SGSN
functionality working in MME).</p>

<p>In computer networking, Gigabit Ethernet (GbE or 1 GigE) is the various
technologies for transmitting Ethernet frames at a rate of a gigabit per
second (1,000,000,000 bits per second), as defined by the IEEE
802.3-2008 standard. It came into use beginning in 1999, gradually
supplanting Fast Ethernet in wired local networks, as a result of being
considerably faster. The cables and equipment are very similar to
previous standards and have been very common and economical since 2010.</p>
<h2 id="git"><a class="header" href="#git">Git</a></h2>
<p>Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files
and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is
primarily used for source code management in software development, but
it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a
distributed revision control system, it is aimed at speed, data
integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>
<p>Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux
kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial
development. Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.</p>
<p>As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most
client--server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a
full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking
abilities, independent of network access or a central server.</p>

<p>In April 2008, Google announced App Engine, a platform for developing
and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers, which was
the first cloud computing service from the company. The service became
generally available in November 2011. Since the announcement of App
Engine, Google added multiple cloud services to the platform.</p>
<p>Google Cloud Platform is a part of Google Cloud, which includes the

<h2 id="gpl"><a class="header" href="#gpl">GPL</a></h2>
<p>The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free
software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study,
share and modify the software. The license was originally written by
Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU
Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of
the Free Software Definition. The GPL is a copyleft license, which means
that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license
terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of
which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL
was the first copyleft license for general use.</p>
<p>Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular
software licenses in the free and open-source software domain. Prominent
free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel
and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the
copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based
systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the
assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free,
rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to
give anything back to the community.</p>
<p>In 2007, the third version of the license (GNU GPLv3) was released to
address some perceived problems with the second version (GNU GPLv2) that
were discovered during its long-time usage. To keep the license up to
date, the GPL license includes an optional &quot;any later version&quot; clause,
allowing users to choose between the original terms or the terms in new
versions as updated by the FSF. Developers can omit it when licensing
their software; for instance the Linux kernel is licensed under GPLv2
without the &quot;any later version&quot; clause.</p>
<h2 id="gprs"><a class="header" href="#gprs">GPRS</a></h2>
<p>General Packet Radio Service</p>
<p>General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet oriented mobile data
standard on the 2G and 3G cellular communication network's global system
for mobile communications (GSM). GPRS was established by European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in response to the earlier
CDPD and i-mode packet-switched cellular technologies. It is now
maintained by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p>
<p>GPRS is typically sold according to the total volume of data transferred
during the billing cycle, in contrast with circuit switched data, which
is usually billed per minute of connection time, or sometimes by
one-third minute increments. Usage above the GPRS bundled data cap may
be charged per Mb of data, speed limited, or disallowed.</p>
<p>GPRS is a best-effort service, implying variable throughput and latency
that depend on the number of other users sharing the service
concurrently, as opposed to circuit switching, where a certain quality
of service (QoS) is guaranteed during the connection. In 2G systems,
GPRS provides data rates of 56--114 kbit/sec. 2G cellular technology
combined with GPRS is sometimes described as 2.5G, that is, a technology
between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony.
It provides moderate-speed data transfer, by using unused time division
multiple access (TDMA) channels in, for example, the GSM system. GPRS is
integrated into GSM Release 97 and newer releases.<br />

<h2 id="gsm"><a class="header" href="#gsm">GSM</a></h2>
<p>GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) is a standard developed by
the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe
the protocols for second-generation digital cellular networks used by
mobile devices such as tablets. It was first deployed in Finland in
December 1991. As of 2014, it has become the global standard for mobile
communications -- with over 90% market share, operating in over 193
countries and territories.</p>
<p>2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog
cellular networks, and the GSM standard originally described a digital,
circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony. This
expanded over time to include data communications, first by
circuit-switched transport, then by packet data transport via GPRS
(General Packet Radio Services) and EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM
Evolution, or EGPRS).</p>
<p>Subsequently, the 3GPP developed third-generation (3G) UMTS standards,
followed by fourth-generation (4G) LTE Advanced standards, which do not
form part of the ETSI GSM standard.<br />

<h2 id="gsm-amr"><a class="header" href="#gsm-amr">GSM AMR</a></h2>
<p>GSM Adaptive Multi-Rate</p>
<p>The Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR, AMR-NB or GSM-AMR) audio codec is an audio
compression format optimized for speech coding. AMR speech codec
consists of a multi-rate narrowband speech codec that encodes narrowband
(200--3400 Hz) signals at variable bit rates ranging from 4.75 to 12.2
kbit/s with toll quality speech starting at 7.4 kbit/s.</p>
<p>AMR was adopted as the standard speech codec by 3GPP in October 1999 and
is now widely used in GSM[4] and UMTS. It uses link adaptation to
select from one of eight different bit rates based on link conditions.</p>
<p>AMR is also a file format for storing spoken audio using the AMR codec.
Many modern mobile telephone handsets can store short audio recordings
in the AMR format, and both free and proprietary programs exist (see
Software support) to convert between this and other formats, although
AMR is a speech format and is unlikely to give ideal results for other
audio. The common filename extension is .amr. There also exists another
storage format for AMR that is suitable for applications with more
advanced demands on the storage format, like random access or
synchronization with video. This format is the 3GPP-specified 3GP
container format based on ISO base media file format.</p>
<h2 id="gsm-fr"><a class="header" href="#gsm-fr">GSM-FR</a></h2>
<p>GSM Full Rate</p>
<p>Full Rate (FR or GSM-FR or GSM 06.10 or sometimes simply GSM) was the
first digital speech coding standard used in the GSM digital mobile
phone system. The bit rate of the codec is 13 kbit/s, or 1.625
bits/audio sample (often padded out to 33 bytes/20 ms or 13.2 kbit/s).
The quality of the coded speech is quite poor by modern standards, but
at the time of development (early 1990s) it was a good compromise
between computational complexity and quality, requiring only on the
order of a million additions and multiplications per second. The codec
is still widely used in networks around the world. Gradually FR will be
replaced by Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR)
standards, which provide much higher speech quality with lower bit rate.</p>
