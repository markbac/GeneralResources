<p>Machine to machine</p>
<p>Machine to machine (commonly abbreviated as M2M) refers to direct
communication between devices using any communications channel,
including wired and wireless. Machine to machine communication can
include industrial instrumentation, enabling a sensor or meter to
communicate the data it records (such as temperature, inventory level,
etc.) to application software that can use it (for example, adjusting an
industrial process based on temperature or placing orders to replenish
inventory). Such communication was originally accomplished by having a
remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for
analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal
computer.</p>
<p>More recent machine to machine communication has changed into a system
of networks that transmits data to personal appliances. The expansion of
IP networks around the world has made machine to machine communication
quicker and easier while using less power. These networks also allow new
business opportunities for consumers and suppliers.</p>
<h2 id="mac"><a class="header" href="#mac">MAC</a></h2>
<p>Media Access Control</p>
<p>In IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards, the medium access control (MAC) sublayer
(also known as the media access control sublayer) and the logical link
control (LLC) sublayer together make up the data link layer. Within that
data link layer, the LLC provides flow control and multiplexing for the
logical link (i.e. EtherType, 802.1Q VLAN tag etc), while the MAC
provides flow control and multiplexing for the transmission medium.</p>
<p>These two sublayers together correspond to layer 2 of the OSI model. For
compatibility reasons, LLC is optional for implementations of IEEE 802.3
(the frames are then &quot;raw&quot;), but compulsory for implementations of all
other IEEE 802 standards. Within the hierarchy of the OSI model and IEEE
802 standards, the MAC block provides a control abstraction of the
physical layer such that the complexities of physical link control are
invisible to the LLC and upper layers of the network stack. Thus any LLC
block (and higher layers) may be used with any MAC. In turn, the medium
access control block is formally connected to the PHY via a
media-independent interface. Although the MAC block is today typically
integrated with the PHY within the same device package, historically any
MAC could be used with any PHY, independent of the transmission medium.</p>
<p>When sending data to another device on the network, the MAC block
encapsulates higher-level frames into frames appropriate for the
transmission medium (i.e. the MAC adds a syncword preamble and also
padding if necessary), adds a frame check sequence to identify
transmission errors, and then forwards the data to the physical layer as
soon as the appropriate channel access method permits it. Controlling
when data is sent and when to wait is necessary to avoid congestion and
collisions, especially for topologies with a collision domain (bus,
ring, mesh, point-to-multipoint topologies). Additionally, the MAC is
also responsible for compensating for congestion and collisions by
initiating retransmission if a jam signal is detected, and/or
negotiating a slower transmission rate if necessary. When receiving data
from the physical layer, the MAC block ensures data integrity by
verifying the sender's frame check sequences, and strips off the
sender's preamble and padding before passing the data up to the higher
layers.</p>
<h2 id="mac-address"><a class="header" href="#mac-address">MAC Address</a></h2>
<p>Media Access Control Address</p>
<p>A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is a unique
identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for
communications at the data link layer of a network segment. MAC
addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network
technologies, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi. In this context, MAC
addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer.</p>
<p>A MAC may be referred to as the burned-in address (BIA). It may also be
known as an Ethernet hardware address (EHA), hardware address or
physical address (not to be confused with a memory physical address).</p>
<p>A network node may have multiple NICs and each NIC must have a unique
MAC address. Sophisticated network equipment such as a multilayer switch
or router may require one or more permanently assigned MAC addresses.</p>
<p>MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a NIC and
are stored in its hardware, such as the card's read-only memory or some
other firmware mechanism. A MAC address may include the manufacturer's
organizationally unique identifier (OUI). MAC addresses are formed
according to the rules of one of three numbering name spaces managed by
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE): MAC-48,
EUI-48, and EUI-64.[1][2] EUI is an abbreviation for Extended Unique
Identifier.</p>

<h2 id="mac-flooding"><a class="header" href="#mac-flooding">MAC Flooding</a></h2>
<p>In computer networking, a media access control attack or MAC flooding is
a technique employed to compromise the security of network switches. The
attack works by forcing legitimate MAC table contents out of the switch
and forcing a unicast flooding behavior potentially sending sensitive
information to portions of the network where it is not normally intended
to go.</p>
<h2 id="mac-spoofing"><a class="header" href="#mac-spoofing">MAC Spoofing</a></h2>
<p>MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access
Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. The
MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC)
cannot be changed. However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be
changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an operating
system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing.
The process of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing.
Essentially, MAC spoofing entails changing a computer's identity, for
any reason, and it is relatively easy.</p>
<h2 id="machine-code"><a class="header" href="#machine-code">Machine code</a></h2>
<p>Machine code is a computer program written in machine language
instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's central
processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very
specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of
data in a CPU register or memory.</p>
<p>Machine code is a strictly numerical language which is intended to run
as fast as possible, and may be regarded as the lowest-level
representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a
primitive and hardware-dependent programming language. While it is
possible to write programs directly in machine code, it is tedious and
error prone to manage individual bits and calculate numerical addresses
and constants manually. For this reason, programs are very rarely
written directly in machine code in modern contexts, but may be done for
low level debugging, program patching, and assembly language
disassembly.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of practical programs today are written in
higher-level languages or assembly language. The source code is then
translated to executable machine code by utilities such as compilers,
assemblers, and linkers, with the important exception of interpreted
programs, which are not translated into machine code. However, the
interpreter itself, which may be seen as an executor or processor,
performing the instructions of the source code, typically consists of
directly executable machine code (generated from assembly or high-level
language source code).</p>
<p>Machine code is by definition the lowest level of programming detail
visible to the programmer, but internally many processors use microcode
or optimise and transform machine code instructions into sequences of
micro-ops, this is not generally considered to be a machine code per se</p>

<p>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a [computer network] that
interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic area or
region larger than that covered by even a large local area network (LAN)
but smaller than the area covered by a wide area network (WAN). The term
MAN is applied to the interconnection of networks in a city into a
single larger network which may then also offer efficient connection to
a wide area network.It is also used to mean the interconnection of
several local area networks in a metropolitan area through the use of
point-to-point connections between them. The latter usage is also
sometimes referred to as a campus network.<br />

<h2 id="management-plane"><a class="header" href="#management-plane">Management Plane</a></h2>
<p>In computer networking, the management plane of a networking device is
the element of a system that configures, monitors, and provides
management, monitoring and configuration services to, all layers of the
network stack and other parts of the system. It should be distinguished
from the control plane, which is primarily concerned with routing table
and forwarding information base computation.</p>
<p>In system diagrams, the management plane is typically shown in three
dimensions as overlapping the network stack, separated by a dimension
that delineates the power plane, data plane, control plane and
management plane.</p>

<h2 id="manet"><a class="header" href="#manet">MANET</a></h2>
<p>Mobile Adhoc NETwork</p>
<p>A mobile ad hoc network (MANET), also known as wireless ad hoc network
or ad hoc wireless network, is a continuously self-configuring,
infrastructure-less network of mobile devices connected wirelessly.</p>
<p>Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction,
and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. Each
must forward traffic unrelated to its own use, and therefore be a
router. The primary challenge in building a MANET is equipping each
device to continuously maintain the information required to properly
route traffic.[4] Such networks may operate by themselves or may be
connected to the larger Internet. They may contain one or multiple and
different transceivers between nodes. This results in a highly dynamic,
autonomous topology.</p>
<p>MANETs are a kind of wireless ad hoc network (WANET) that usually has a
routable networking environment on top of a Link Layer ad hoc network.
MANETs consist of a peer-to-peer, self-forming, self-healing network.
MANETs circa 2000--2015 typically communicate at radio frequencies (30
MHz -- 5 GHz).<br />

<p>Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services</p>
<p>Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (MBMS) is a point-to-multipoint
interface specification for existing and upcoming 3GPP cellular
networks, which is designed to provide efficient delivery of broadcast
and multicast services, both within a cell as well as within the core
network. For broadcast transmission across multiple cells, it defines
transmission via single-frequency network configurations. The
specification is referred to as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast
Services (eMBMS) when transmissions are delivered through an LTE (Long
Term Evolution) network. eMBMS is also known as LTE Broadcast.</p>
<p>Target applications include mobile TV and radio broadcasting, live

<h2 id="md5"><a class="header" href="#md5">MD5</a></h2>
<p>Message Digest 5</p>
<p>The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit
hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a
cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive
vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data
integrity, but only against unintentional corruption.</p>
<p>Like most hash functions, MD5 is neither encryption nor encoding. It can
be cracked by brute-force attack and suffers from extensive
vulnerabilities as detailed in the security section below.</p>
<p>MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash
function MD4.[3] The source code in RFC 1321 contains a &quot;by
attribution&quot; RSA license. The abbreviation &quot;MD&quot; stands for &quot;Message
Digest.&quot;</p>
<p>The security of MD5 has been severely compromised, with its weaknesses
having been exploited in the field, most infamously by the Flame malware
in 2012. The CMU Software Engineering Institute considers MD5
essentially &quot;cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use&quot;</p>

<h2 id="mediation"><a class="header" href="#mediation">Mediation</a></h2>
<p>Telecommunications mediation is a process that converts call data to
pre-defined layouts that can be imported by a specific billing system or
other OSS applications<br />
A billing mediation platform is a system used to convert data of certain
datatypes to other datatypes, usually for billing purposes. Billing
Mediation Platforms are used mostly by telephone companies, who
typically need to process UDRs (Usage Detail Records). In call scenarios
UDRs are most often known as CDRs (Call Detail Records), and among
broadband carriers they are often referred to as IPDR<br />
Billing mediation platforms get their name from their behavior: they
&quot;mediate&quot; data between systems. In a typical telephone company scenario,
the systems providing data to the mediation platform are network
elements, such as telephone switches, and the systems receiving data
from the mediation platform perform accounting, auditing, archiving, or
bill-generation functions. The mediation system collects, collates and
prepares data for consumption by the downstream systems, which often
accept data only in a limited set of formats.<br />
Functionality<br />
Typically a mediation platform is used for the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Collection and validation of CDRs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtering out of non billing-relevant CDRs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correlation of different input sources CDRs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregation of partial CDRs related to the same call</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Format change and CDRs normalization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business transformation of data</p>
<p>In a telecom billing scenario, mediation is the first step after
receiving a CDR. The mediated CDR is forwarded to a rating engine,
which calculates the charge associated with the CDRs. In today's
world Rating Engines are more becoming necessary for the telecom
billing system to meet the growing variant customer needs for
different services.[citation needed]</p>
<p>Despite the name, not all of the data transferred via billing
mediation platforms is actually used for billing purposes. For
instance, the mediation software might generate traffic volume
statistics based on the number and origin of the records passing
through it. Those statistics could then be used for capacity
planning, as part of a network monitoring procedure, or for any
other business intelligence applications.</p>
<p>At core Mediation involves data transfer between various systems
with or without modification of data starting from Network elements
to OSS/BSS systems.</p>
<p>Sophisticated Billing Mediation software serves end to end
functionality for telecom operators. Mediation software performs
various operation from data collection to downstream distribution to
modules like retail billing, interconnect settlement, business
intelligence, fraud detection and revenue assurance.</p>

<p>Provisioning services for the subscription.</p>
<p>Complementary to Billing Mediation functions, comprehensive
mediation platforms also provide functionality dedicated to Service
Provisioning (the two areas frequently intermix as services
configured and used by the end customer result in usage data records
generation in the network).</p>
<p>Mediating between the systems is not the only job that Mediation
Platform can do. Actually this can be used as a provisioning agent.
The basic provisioning commands can be configured within the
mediation system and whenever we get a request for the system which
does the provisioning, the request can be converted into a file, in
which mediation can append the service provisioning commands and
send it to HLR for activating any request. This of course, load
dependent but can come very handy when there is a crisis in the
other system.</p>

<h2 id="melp"><a class="header" href="#melp">MELP</a></h2>
<p>Mixed-excitation linear prediction</p>
<p>Mixed-excitation linear prediction (MELP) is a United States Department
of Defense speech coding standard used mainly in military applications
and satellite communications, secure voice, and secure radio devices.
Its standardization and later development was led and supported by NSA,
and NATO.<br />
Compression level<br />
MELPe is intended for the compression of speech. Given an audio input
sampled at 8 kHz, the MELPe codec yields the following compression
ratios over a 64 kbit/s μ-Law G.711 datastream, discounting the effects
of protocol overhead:</p>
<p><img src="./images/M/14909510.png" alt="" /><br />
Generally, speech coding involves a trade-off of different aspects
including bit-rate, speech quality, delay (frame size and lookahead),
computational complexity, robustness to different speakers and
languages, robustness to different background noises, channel error
robustness, and also codec state recovery in the face of packet loss.
Since the MELPe's lower rates (600 and 1200 bit/s) are supersets of the
2400 bit/s rate, the algorithm complexity (e.g. in MIPS) is about the
same for all rates. The lower rates use increased frames and lookahead,
as well as codebook size, therefore they require more memory.  </p>

<h2 id="mgcp"><a class="header" href="#mgcp">MGCP</a></h2>
<p>Media Gateway Control Protocol</p>
<p>The Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) is a signaling and call
control communications protocol used in voice over IP (VoIP)
telecommunication systems. It implements the media gateway control
protocol architecture for controlling media gateways on Internet
Protocol (IP) networks connected to the public switched telephone
network (PSTN). The protocol is a successor to the Simple Gateway
Control Protocol (SGCP), which was developed by Bellcore and Cisco, and
the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC).</p>
<p>The methodology of MGCP reflects the structure of the PSTN with the
power of the network residing in a call control center softswitch which
is analogous to the central office in the telephone network. The
endpoints are low-intelligence devices, mostly executing control
commands and providing result indications in response. The protocol
represents a decomposition of other VoIP models, such as H.323, in which
the H.323 Gatekeeper, have higher levels of signaling intelligence.</p>
<p>MGCP is a text-based protocol consisting of commands and responses. It
uses the Session Description Protocol (SDP) for specifying and
negotiating the media streams to be transmitted in a call session and
the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for framing the media streams.<br />

communication standards including IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.11ac
(Wi-Fi), HSPA+ (3G), WiMAX (4G), and Long Term Evolution (LTE 4G). More
recently, MIMO has been applied to power-line communication for 3-wire
installations as part of ITU <a href="http://g.hn/">G.hn</a> standard and HomePlug
AV2 specification.</p>
<p>At one time, in wireless the term &quot;MIMO&quot; referred to the use of multiple

<h2 id="mobile-cell"><a class="header" href="#mobile-cell">Mobile Cell</a></h2>
<p>Modern mobile phone networks use cells because radio frequencies are a
limited, shared resource. Cell-sites and handsets change frequency under
computer control and use low power transmitters so that the usually
limited number of radio frequencies can be simultaneously used by many
callers with less interference.</p>
<p>A cellular network is used by the mobile phone operator to achieve both
coverage and capacity for their subscribers. Large geographic areas are
split into smaller cells to avoid line-of-sight signal loss and to
support a large number of active phones in that area. All of the cell
sites are connected to telephone exchanges (or switches), which in turn
connect to the public telephone network.</p>
<p>In cities, each cell site may have a range of up to approximately 1⁄2
mile (0.80 km), while in rural areas, the range could be as much as 5
miles (8.0 km). It is possible that in clear open areas, a user may
receive signals from a cell site 25 miles (40 km) away.</p>
<p>Since almost all mobile phones use cellular technology, including GSM,
CDMA, and AMPS (analog), the term &quot;cell phone&quot; is in some regions,
notably the US, used interchangeably with &quot;mobile phone&quot;. However,
satellite phones are mobile phones that do not communicate directly with
a ground-based cellular tower, but may do so indirectly by way of a
satellite.</p>
<p>There are a number of different digital cellular technologies,
including: Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet
Radio Service (GPRS), cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Evolution-Data Optimized
(EV-DO), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS), Digital Enhanced Cordless
Telecommunications (DECT), Digital AMPS (IS-136/TDMA), and Integrated
Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN). The transition from existing analog to
the digital standard followed a very different path in Europe and the
US.[11] As a consequence, multiple digital standards surfaced in the
US, while Europe and many countries converged towards the GSM standard.</p>

<h2 id="mp3"><a class="header" href="#mp3">MP3</a></h2>
<p>MP3 (formally MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III) is an
audio coding format for digital audio. Originally defined as the third
audio format of the MPEG-1 standard, it was retained and further
extended---defining additional bit rates and support for more audio
channels---as the third audio format of the subsequent MPEG-2 standard.
A third version, known as MPEG 2.5---extended to better support lower
bit rates---is commonly implemented, but is not a recognized standard.</p>
<p>MP3 (or mp3) as a file format commonly designates files containing an
elementary stream of MPEG-1 audio and video encoded data, without other
complexities of the MP3 standard.</p>
<p>In the aspects of MP3 pertaining to audio compression---the aspect of
the standard most apparent to end users (and for which is it best
known)---MP3 uses lossy data compression to encode data using inexact
approximations and the partial discarding of data. This allows a large
reduction in file size when compared to uncompressed audio. The
combination of small size and acceptable fidelity led to a boom in the
distribution of music over the Internet in the mid to late 1990s, as an
enabling technology when bandwidth and storage were still at a premium.
The MP3 format soon became associated with controversies surrounding
copyright infringement, music piracy, the file ripping/sharing
services <a href="http://mp3.com/">MP3.com</a> and Napster, among others. With the
advent of portable media players, a product category also including
smartphones, MP3 support remains near-universal.</p>
<p>MP3 compression works by reducing (or approximating) the accuracy of
certain components of sound that are considered to be beyond the hearing
capabilities of most humans. This method is commonly referred to as
perceptual coding, or psychoacoustic modeling. The remaining audio
information is then recorded in a space-efficient manner. Compared to
CD-quality digital audio, MP3 compression can commonly achieve a 75 to
95% reduction in size. For example, an MP3 encoded at a constant bitrate
of 128 kbit/s would result in a file approximately 9% the size of the
original CD audio.</p>
<p>Also designed as a streamable format, segments of a transmission can be
lost without affecting the ability to decode later segments.</p>

<p>Message Queuing Telemetry Transport</p>
<p>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC
PRF 20922) publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on top
of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote
locations where a &quot;small code footprint&quot; is required or the network
bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a
message broker.</p>
<p>Andy Stanford-Clark of IBM and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link authored the
first version of the protocol in 1999.</p>
<p>The specification does not specify the meaning of &quot;small code footprint&quot;
or the meaning of &quot;limited network bandwidth&quot;. Thus, the protocol's
availability for use depends on the context. In 2013, IBM submitted MQTT
v3.1 to the OASIS specification body with a charter that ensured only
minor changes to the specification could be accepted. MQTT-SN is a
variation of the main protocol aimed at embedded devices on non-TCP/IP
networks, such as ZigBee.</p>
<p>Historically, the &quot;MQ&quot; in &quot;MQTT&quot; came from IBM's MQ Series message
queuing product line.[6] However, queuing itself is not required to be
supported as a standard feature in all situations.</p>

<p>Multi-Service Access Node</p>
<p>A multi-service access node (MSAN), also known as a multi-service access
gateway (MSAG), is a device typically installed in a telephone exchange
(although sometimes in a roadside serving area interface cabinet) which
connects customers' telephone lines to the core network, to provide
telephone, ISDN, and broadband such as DSL all from a single platform.<br />

<h2 id="msc"><a class="header" href="#msc">MSC</a></h2>
<p>Mobile switching center</p>
<p>The mobile switching center (MSC) is the primary service delivery node
for GSM/CDMA, responsible for routing voice calls and SMS as well as
other services (such as conference calls, FAX and circuit switched
data).</p>
<p>The MSC sets up and releases the end-to-end connection, handles mobility
and hand-over requirements during the call and takes care of charging
and real time prepaid account monitoring.</p>
<p>In the GSM mobile phone system, in contrast with earlier analogue
services, fax and data information is sent digitally encoded directly to
the MSC. Only at the MSC is this re-coded into an &quot;analogue&quot; signal
(although actually this will almost certainly mean sound is encoded
digitally as a pulse-code modulation (PCM) signal in a 64-kbit/s
timeslot, known as a DS0 in America).</p>
<p>There are various different names for MSCs in different contexts which
reflects their complex role in the network, all of these terms though
could refer to the same MSC, but doing different things at different
times.</p>
<p>The gateway MSC (G-MSC) is the MSC that determines which &quot;visited MSC&quot;
(V-MSC) the subscriber who is being called is currently located at. It
also interfaces with the PSTN. All mobile to mobile calls and PSTN to
mobile calls are routed through a G-MSC. The term is only valid in the
context of one call, since any MSC may provide both the gateway function
and the visited MSC function. However, some manufacturers design
dedicated high capacity MSCs which do not have any base station
subsystems (BSS) connected to them. These MSCs will then be the gateway
MSC for many of the calls they handle.</p>
<p>The visited MSC (V-MSC) is the MSC where a customer is currently
located. The visitor location register (VLR) associated with this MSC
will have the subscriber's data in it.</p>
<p>The anchor MSC is the MSC from which a handover has been initiated. The
target MSC is the MSC toward which a handover should take place. A
mobile switching center server is a part of the redesigned MSC concept
starting from 3GPP Release 4.</p>

<h2 id="mtp"><a class="header" href="#mtp">MTP</a></h2>
<p>Message Transfer Part</p>
<p>The (MTP) is part of the Signaling System 7 (SS7) used for communication
in Public Switched Telephone Networks. MTP is responsible for reliable,
unduplicated and in-sequence transport of SS7 messages between
communication partners.</p>
<p>MTP is formally defined primarily in ITU-T recommendations Q.701, Q.702,
Q.703, Q.704 and Q.705. Tests for the MTP are specified in the ITU-T
recommendations Q.781 for MTP2 and in Q.782 for MTP3. These tests are
used to validate the correct implementation of the MTP protocol.</p>
<p>Functional levels<br />
The SS7 stack can be separated into four functional levels: Level 1
through Level 3 comprise the MTP, and Level 4 the MTP user. MTP Level 3
is sometimes abbreviated MTP3; MTP Level 2, MTP2. MTP and SCCP are
together referred to as the Network Service Part (NSP).</p>
<p>There is no one-to-one mapping of MTP Levels 1 through 3 onto the OSI
model. Instead, MTP provides the functionality of layers 1, 2 and part
of layer 3 in the OSI model. The part of layer 3 of the OSI model that
MTP does not provide, is provided by SCCP or other Level 4 parts (MTP
users).</p>

<p>Mean Time to Repair</p>
<p>Mean time to repair (MTTR) is the average time required to troubleshoot

<h2 id="mtu"><a class="header" href="#mtu">MTU</a></h2>
<p>In computer networking, the maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size
of the largest protocol data unit (PDU) that can be communicated in a
single network layer transaction. The MTU relates to, but is not
identical to the maximum frame size that can be transported on the data
link layer, e.g. Ethernet frame.</p>
<p>Larger MTU is associated with reduced overhead. Smaller MTU values can
reduce network delay. In many cases, MTU is dependent on underlying
network capabilities and must be adjusted manually or automatically so
as to not exceed these capabilities. MTU parameters may appear in
association with a communications interface or standard. Some systems
may decide MTU at connect time.</p>
<h2 id="multicast"><a class="header" href="#multicast">Multicast</a></h2>
<p>In computer networking, multicast is group communication where data
transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers
simultaneously. Multicast can be one-to-many or many-to-many
distribution. Multicast should not be confused with physical layer
point-to-multipoint communication.</p>
<p>Group communication may either be application layer multicast or network
assisted multicast, where the latter makes it possible for the source to
efficiently send to the group in a single transmission. Copies are
automatically created in other network elements, such as routers,
switches and cellular network base stations, but only to network
segments that currently contain members of the group. Network assisted
multicast may be implemented at the data link layer using one-to-many
addressing and switching such as Ethernet multicast addressing,
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), point-to-multipoint virtual circuits
<a href="3">P2MP</a> or Infiniband multicast. Network assisted multicast may also
be implemented at the Internet layer using IP multicast. In IP multicast
the implementation of the multicast concept occurs at the IP routing
level, where routers create optimal distribution paths for datagrams
sent to a multicast destination address.</p>
<p>Multicast is often employed in Internet Protocol (IP) applications of
streaming media, such as IPTV and multipoint videoconferencing.</p>

<h2 id="multiplex"><a class="header" href="#multiplex">Multiplex</a></h2>
<p>In telecommunications and computer networks, multiplexing (sometimes
contracted to muxing) is a method by which multiple analog or digital
signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium. The aim is to
share a scarce resource. For example, in telecommunications, several
telephone calls may be carried using one wire. Multiplexing originated
in telegraphy in the 1870s, and is now widely applied in communications.
In telephony, George Owen Squier is credited with the development of
telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910.</p>
<p>The multiplexed signal is transmitted over a communication channel such
as a cable. The multiplexing divides the capacity of the communication
channel into several logical channels, one for each message signal or
data stream to be transferred. A reverse process, known as
demultiplexing, extracts the original channels on the receiver end.</p>
<p>A device that performs the multiplexing is called a multiplexer (MUX),
and a device that performs the reverse process is called a demultiplexer
(DEMUX or DMX).</p>
<h2 id="mutex"><a class="header" href="#mutex">Mutex</a></h2>
<p>In computer science, a lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a
synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource
in an environment where there are many threads of execution. A lock is
designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy.</p>
<h2 id="mutual-exclusion"><a class="header" href="#mutual-exclusion">Mutual Exclusion</a></h2>
<p>In computer science, mutual exclusion is a property of concurrency
control, which is instituted for the purpose of preventing race
conditions; it is the requirement that one thread of execution never
enter its critical section at the same time that another concurrent
thread of execution enters its own critical section.</p>
<p>The requirement of mutual exclusion was first identified and solved by
Edsger W. Dijkstra in his seminal 1965 paper titled Solution of a
problem in concurrent programming control,[1][2] which is credited
as the first topic in the study of concurrent algorithms.</p>
<p>A simple example of why mutual exclusion is important in practice can be
visualized using a singly linked list of four items, where the second
and third are to be removed. The removal of a node that sits between 2
other nodes is performed by changing the next pointer of the previous
node to point to the next node (in other words, if node i is being
removed, then the next pointer of node i - 1 is changed to point to node
i + 1, thereby removing from the linked list any reference to node i).
When such a linked list is being shared between multiple threads of
execution, two threads of execution may attempt to remove two different
nodes simultaneously, one thread of execution changing the next pointer
of node i - 1 to point to node i + 1, while another thread of execution
changes the next pointer of node i to point to node i + 2. Although both
removal operations complete successfully, the desired state of the
linked list is not achieved: node i + 1 remains in the list, because the
next pointer of node i - 1 points to node i + 1.</p>
<p>This problem (called a race condition) can be avoided by using the
requirement of mutual exclusion to ensure that simultaneous updates to
the same part of the list cannot occur.</p>
<p>The term mutual exclusion is also used in reference to the simultaneous
writing of a memory address by one thread while the aforementioned
memory address is being manipulated or read by another thread or other
threads.</p>

<p>mobile virtual network enabler</p>
<p>A mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE) is a company that provides
network infrastructure and related services, such as business support
systems, administration and operations support systems to a Mobile
Virtual Network Operator (MVNO). This enables MVNOs to offer services to
their own customers with their own brands. The MVNE does not have a
relationship with consumers, but rather is a provider of network
enablement platforms and services.</p>
<h2 id="mvno"><a class="header" href="#mvno">MVNO</a></h2>
<p>Mobile Virtual Network Operator</p>
<p>A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), virtual network operator
(VNO), or mobile other licensed operator (MOLO), is a wireless
communications services provider that does not own the wireless network
infrastructure over which it provides services to its customers. An MVNO
enters into a business agreement with a mobile network operator to
obtain bulk access to network services at wholesale rates, then sets
retail prices independently. An MVNO may use its own customer service,
billing support systems, marketing, and sales personnel, or it could
employ the services of a mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE).</p>
