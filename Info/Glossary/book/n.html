<p>Network as a Service</p>
<p>Network as a service (NaaS) describes services for network transport
connectivity. NaaS involves the optimization of resource allocations by
considering network and computing resources as a unified whole</p>
<p>The term &quot;Network as a service&quot; (NaaS) is often used along with other
marketing terms like cloud computing, along with acronyms such as
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS),
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Communication-as-a-Service (CaaS).</p>
<p>NaaS sometimes includes the provision of a virtual network service by
the owners of the network infrastructure to a third party. Often this
includes network virtualization using a protocol such as OpenFlow.</p>
<p>Some service models are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Private Network (VPN): Extends a private network and the
resources contained in the network across networks like the public
Internet. It enables a host computer to send and receive data across
shared or public networks as if it were a private network with the
functionality and policies of the private network.</li>
<li>Bandwidth on demand (BoD): Technique by which network capacity is
assigned based on requirements between different nodes or users.
Under this model link rates can be dynamically adapted to the
traffic demands of the nodes connected to the link.</li>
<li>Mobile network virtualization: Model in which a telecommunications
manufacturer or independent network operator builds and operates a
network (wireless, or transport connectivity) and sells its
communication access capabilities to third parties (commonly mobile
phone operators) charging by capacity utilization. A mobile virtual
network operator (MVNO), is a mobile communications services
provider that does not own the radio spectrum or wireless network
infrastructure over which it provides services. Commonly a MVNO
offers its communication services using the network infrastructure
of an established mobile network operator.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="napt"><a class="header" href="#napt">NAPT</a></h2>
<p>Network Address Port Translation</p>
<p>All IP packets have a source IP address and a destination IP address.
Typically packets passing from the private network to the public network
will have their source address modified, while packets passing from the
public network back to the private network will have their destination
address modified. To avoid ambiguity in how replies are translated,
further modifications to the packets are required. The vast bulk of
Internet traffic uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User
Datagram Protocol (UDP). For these protocols the port numbers are
changed so that the combination of IP address and port information on
the returned packet can be unambiguously mapped to the corresponding
private network destination. RFC 2663 uses the term network address and
port translation (NAPT) for this type of NAT. Other names include port
address translation (PAT), IP masquerading, NAT overload and many-to-one
NAT. This is the most common type of NAT and has become synonymous with
the term &quot;NAT&quot; in common usage.</p>

a Terminal Server or Remote Access Server (RAS).<br />

<h2 id="nat"><a class="header" href="#nat">NAT</a></h2>
<p>Network Address Translation</p>
<p>Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP
address space into another by modifying network address information in
the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic
routing device. The technique was originally used as a shortcut to avoid
the need to readdress every host when a network was moved. It has become
a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the
face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a
NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.</p>
<p>IP masquerading is a technique that hides an entire IP address space,
usually consisting of private IP addresses, behind a single IP address
in another, usually public address space. The address that has to be
hidden is changed into a single (public) IP address as &quot;new&quot; source
address of the outgoing IP packet so it appears as originating not from
the hidden host but from the routing device itself. Because of the
popularity of this technique to conserve IPv4 address space, the term
NAT has become virtually synonymous with IP masquerading.</p>
<p>As network address translation modifies the IP address information in
packets, it has serious consequences on the quality of Internet
connectivity and requires careful attention to the details of its
implementation. NAT implementations vary widely in their specific
behavior in various addressing cases and their effect on network
traffic. The specifics of NAT behavior are not commonly documented by
vendors of equipment containing NAT implementations.<br />

<p>Node-B Application Part</p>
<p>In the 3GPP UTRAN architecture, NBAP (Node B Application Part) is the
signalling protocol responsible for the control of the Node B by the
RNC. NBAP is subdivided into Common and Dedicated NBAP (C-NBAP and
D-NBAP), where Common NBAP controls overall Node B functionality, and
Dedicated NBAP controls radio links to specific user equipment. NBAP
forms part of the Iub interface.</p>
<p>NBAP handles two kind of Procedures for different NBAP functionalities

BCCH Broadcast for creating new Node B Communication Context Dedicated
Procedures for handling procedures of an existing Node B Communication
Context in a TTP/CCP.</p>
<p>NB-IoT Narrowband IoT</p>
<p>Narrowband Internet of things (NB-IoT) is a low-power wide-area network
(LPWAN) radio technology standard developed by 3GPP for cellular devices
and services. The specification was frozen in 3GPP Release 13 (LTE
Advanced Pro), in June 2016. Other 3GPP IoT technologies include eMTC
(enhanced Machine-Type Communication) and EC-GSM-IoT.</p>
<p>NB-IoT focuses specifically on indoor coverage, low cost, long battery
life, and high connection density. NB-IoT uses a subset of the LTE
standard, but limits the bandwidth to a single narrow-band of 200kHz. It
uses OFDM modulation for downlink communication and SC-FDMA for uplink
communications. IoT applications which require more frequent
communications will be better served by NB-IoT, which has no duty cycle
limitations operating on the licensed spectrum.</p>
<p>The NB-IoT technology operates using resource blocks on existing LTE
networks or in the LTE carrier's guard bands. It can also operate using
unused 200 khz bands that were previously used by GSM.</p>

<h2 id="network-topologies"><a class="header" href="#network-topologies">Network Topologies</a></h2>
<p>Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.)
of a communication network.</p>
<p>Network topology is the topological[3] structure of a network and may
be depicted physically or logically. It is an application of graph
theory[4] wherein communicating devices are modeled as nodes and the
connections between the devices are modeled as links or lines between
the nodes. Physical topology is the placement of the various components
of a network (e.g., device location and cable installation), while
logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network. Distances
between nodes, physical interconnections, transmission rates, or signal
types may differ between two different networks, yet their topologies
may be identical. A network's physical topology is a particular concern
of the physical layer of the OSI model. Network topology can be used to
define or describe the arrangement of various types of telecommunication
networks, including command and control radio networks,[4] industrial
fieldbusses, and computer networks.</p>
<p>Examples of network typologies are found in local area networks (LAN), a
common computer network installation. Any given node in the LAN has one
or more physical links to other devices in the network; graphically
mapping these links results in a geometric shape that can be used to
describe the physical topology of the network. A wide variety of
physical topologies have been used in LANs, including ring, bus, mesh
and star. Conversely, mapping the data flow between the components
determines the logical topology of the network. In comparison,
Controller Area Networks, common in vehicles, are primarily distributed
control system networks of one or more controllers interconnected with
sensors and actuators over, invariably, a physical bus topology.<br />

<h2 id="nfs"><a class="header" href="#nfs">NFS</a></h2>
<p>Network File System</p>
<p>Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol
originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984, allowing a user on a
client computer to access files over a computer network much like local
storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open
Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system. The NFS is an
open standard defined in Request for Comments (RFC), allowing anyone to
implement the protocol.</p>
<h2 id="ngn"><a class="header" href="#ngn">NGN</a></h2>
<p>Next Generation Networks</p>
<p>The next-generation network (NGN) is a body of key architectural changes
in telecommunication core and access networks. The general idea behind
the NGN is that one network transports all information and services
(voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating
these into IP packets, similar to those used on the Internet. NGNs are
commonly built around the Internet Protocol, and therefore the term all
IP is also sometimes used to describe the transformation of formerly
telephone-centric networks toward NGN.</p>
<p>According to ITU-T, the definition is:</p>
<p>A next-generation network (NGN) is a packet-based network which can
provide services including Telecommunication Services and is able to
make use of multiple broadband, quality of Service-enabled transport
technologies and in which service-related functions are independent from
underlying transport-related technologies. It offers unrestricted access
by users to different service providers. It supports generalized
mobility which will allow consistent and ubiquitous provision of
services to users.<br />
From a practical perspective, NGN involves three main architectural
changes that need to be looked at separately:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the core network, NGN implies a consolidation of several
(dedicated or overlay) transport networks each historically built
for a different service into one core transport network (often based
on IP and Ethernet). It implies amongst others the migration of
voice from a circuit-switched architecture (PSTN) to VoIP, and also
migration of legacy services such as X.25, frame relay (either
commercial migration of the customer to a new service like IP VPN,
or technical emigration by emulation of the &quot;legacy service&quot; on the
NGN).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the wired access network, NGN implies the migration from the dual
system of legacy voice next to xDSL setup in local exchanges to a
converged setup in which the DSLAMs integrate voice ports or VoIP,
making it possible to remove the voice switching infrastructure from
the exchange.[2]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the cable access network, NGN convergence implies migration of
constant bit rate voice to CableLabs PacketCable standards that
provide VoIP and SIP services. Both services ride over DOCSIS as the
cable data layer standard.</p>
<p>In an NGN, there is a more defined separation between the transport
(connectivity) portion of the network and the services that run on
top of that transport. This means that whenever a provider wants to
enable a new service, they can do so by defining it directly at the
service layer without considering the transport layer --
i.e. services are independent of transport details. Increasingly
applications, including voice, tend to be independent of the access
network (de-layering of network and applications) and will reside
more on end-user devices (phone, PC, set-top box).</p>
<p>Underlying technology components<br />
Next-generation networks are based on Internet technologies
including Internet Protocol (IP) and multiprotocol label switching
(MPLS). At the application level, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
seems to be taking over from ITU-T H.323.</p>
<p>Initially H.323 was the most popular protocol, though its popularity
decreased in the &quot;local loop&quot; due to its original poor traversal of
network address translation (NAT) and firewalls. For this reason as
domestic VoIP services have been developed, SIP has been more widely
adopted. However, in voice networks where everything is under the
control of the network operator or telco, many of the largest
carriers use H.323 as the protocol of choice in their core
backbones.[citation needed] With the most recent changes
introduced for H.323, it is now possible for H.323 devices to easily
and consistently traverse NAT and firewall devices, opening up the
possibility that H.323 may again be looked upon more favorably in
cases where such devices encumbered its use previously. Nonetheless,
most of the telcos are extensively researching and supporting IP
Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which gives SIP a major chance of being
the most widely adopted protocol.</p>
<p>For voice applications one of the most important devices in NGN is a
Softswitch -- a programmable device that controls Voice over IP
(VoIP) calls. It enables correct integration of different protocols
within NGN. The most important function of the Softswitch is
creating the interface to the existing telephone network, PSTN,
through Signalling Gateways and Media Gateways. However, the
Softswitch as a term may be defined differently by the different
equipment manufacturers and have somewhat different functions.</p>
<p>One may quite often find the term Gatekeeper in NGN literature. This
was originally a VoIP device, which converted (using gateways) voice
and data from their analog or digital switched-circuit form (PSTN,
SS7) to the packet-based one (IP). It controlled one or more
gateways. As soon as this kind of device started using the Media
Gateway Control Protocol, the name was changed to Media Gateway
Controller (MGC).</p>
<p>A Call Agent is a general name for devices/systems controlling
calls.</p>
<p>The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a standardised NGN architecture
for an Internet media-services capability defined by the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).</p>

<p>Weighted Fair Queueing</p>
<p>See PWFQ<br />
Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) is a network scheduler scheduling
algorithm. WFQ is both a packet-based implementation of the generalized
processor sharing (GPS) policy, and a natural extension of fair queuing
(FQ). Whereas FQ shares the link's capacity in equal subparts, WFQ
allows schedulers to specify, for each flow, which fraction of the
capacity will be given.</p>
<p>Weighted fair queuing is also known as packet-by-packet GPS (PGPS or
P-GPS) since it approximates generalized processor sharing &quot;to within
one packet transmission time, regardless of the arrival patterns.&quot;<br />

<h2 id="nni"><a class="header" href="#nni">NNI</a></h2>
<p>Network-to-network interface</p>
<p>See UNI<br />
In telecommunications, a network-to-network interface (NNI) is an
interface that specifies signalling and management functions between two
networks. An NNI circuit can be used for interconnection of signalling
(e.g., SS7), Internet Protocol (IP) (e.g., MPLS) or ATM networks.</p>
<p>In networks based on MPLS or GMPLS, NNI is used for the interconnection
of core Provider Routers (class 4 or higher). In the case of GMPLS, the
type of interconnection can vary across Back-to-Back, EBGP or mixed NNI
connection scenarios, depending on the type of VRF exchange used for
interconnection. In case of Back-to-Back, VRF is necessary to create
VLANs and subsequently sub-interfaces (VLAN headers and DLCI headers for
Ethernet and frame relay network packets) on each interface used for the
NNI circuit. In the case of eBGP NNI interconnection, P routers are
taught how to dynamically exchange VRF records without VLAN creation.
NNI also can be used for interconnection of two VoIP nodes. In cases of
mixed or full-mesh scenarios, other NNI types are possible.<br />

<h2 id="nntp"><a class="header" href="#nntp">NNTP</a></h2>
<p>Network News Transfer Protocol</p>
<p>The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is an application protocol
used for transporting Usenet news articles (netnews) between news
servers and for reading and posting articles by end user client
applications. Brian Kantor of the University of California, San Diego
and Phil Lapsley of the University of California, Berkeley wrote RFC
977, the specification for the Network News Transfer Protocol, in March
1986. Other contributors included Stan O. Barber from the Baylor College
of Medicine and Erik Fair of Apple Computer.</p>
<p>Usenet was originally designed based on the UUCP network, with most
article transfers taking place over direct point-to-point telephone
links between news servers, which were powerful time-sharing systems.
Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles
directly from the local disk.</p>
<p>As local area networks and Internet participation proliferated, it
became desirable to allow newsreaders to be run on personal computers
connected to local networks. The resulting protocol was NNTP, which
resembled the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) but was tailored for
exchanging newsgroup articles.</p>
<h2 id="noc"><a class="header" href="#noc">NOC</a></h2>
<p>Network Operation Centre</p>
<p>A network operations center (NOC, pronounced like the word knock), also

exercised over a computer, telecommunication or satellite network.</p>
<h2 id="node-b"><a class="header" href="#node-b">Node B</a></h2>
<p>Node B is the telecommunications node in particular mobile communication
networks, namely those that adhere to the UMTS standard. The Node B
provides the connection between mobile phones (UEs) and the wider
telephone network. UMTS is the dominating 3G standard.</p>
<p>Node B corresponds to BTS (base transceiver station) in GSM.</p>
<p>Functionality<br />
This is the hardware that is connected to the mobile phone network that
communicates directly with mobile handsets. In contrast with GSM base
stations, Node B uses WCDMA/TD-SCDMA as the air interface technology. As
in all cellular systems, such as UMTS and GSM, the Node B contains radio
frequency transmitter(s) and the receiver(s) used to communicate
directly with mobile devices, which move freely around it. In this type
of cellular network, the mobile devices cannot communicate directly with
each other but have to communicate with the NodeB.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the Node Bs have minimum functionality, and are
controlled by an RNC (Radio Network Controller). However, this is
changing with the emergence of High Speed Downlink Packet Access
(HSDPA), where some logic (e.g., retransmission) is handled on the Node
B for lower response times.</p>

<h2 id="nosql"><a class="header" href="#nosql">NoSQL</a></h2>
<p>A NoSQL (originally referring to &quot;non SQL&quot; or &quot;non relational&quot;) database
provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled
in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the
&quot;NoSQL&quot; moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first
century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases
are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL
systems are also sometimes called &quot;Not only SQL&quot; to emphasize that they
may support SQL-like query languages.</p>
<p>Motivations for this approach include: simplicity of design, simpler
&quot;horizontal&quot; scaling to clusters of machines (which is a
problem for relational databases), and finer control over availability.
The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, wide
column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in
relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The
particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem
it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are
also viewed as &quot;more flexible&quot; than relational database tables.</p>
<p>Many NoSQL stores compromise consistency (in the sense of the CAP
theorem) in favor of availability, partition tolerance, and speed.
Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL stores include the use of
low-level query languages (instead of SQL, for instance the lack of
ability to perform ad-hoc joins across tables), lack of standardized
interfaces, and huge previous investments in existing relational
databases.[ Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions, although a
few databases, such as MarkLogic, Aerospike, FairCom c-treeACE, Google
Spanner (though technically a NewSQL database), Symas LMDB, and OrientDB
have made them central to their designs. (See ACID and join support.)</p>
<p>Instead, most NoSQL databases offer a concept of &quot;eventual consistency&quot;
in which database changes are propagated to all nodes &quot;eventually&quot;
(typically within milliseconds) so queries for data might not return
updated data immediately or might result in reading data that is not
accurate, a problem known as stale reads. Additionally, some NoSQL
systems may exhibit lost writes and other forms of data loss. Some NoSQL
systems provide concepts such as write-ahead logging to avoid data
loss. For distributed transaction processing across multiple databases,
data consistency is an even bigger challenge that is difficult for both
NoSQL and relational databases. Even current relational databases &quot;do
not allow referential integrity constraints to span databases.&quot; There
are few systems that maintain both ACID transactions and X/Open XA
standards for distributed transaction processing.</p>

<h2 id="nss"><a class="header" href="#nss">NSS</a></h2>
<p>Network switching subsystem</p>
<p>Network switching subsystem (NSS) (or GSM core network) is the component
of a GSM system that carries out call out and mobility management
functions for mobile phones roaming on the network of base stations. It
is owned and deployed by mobile phone operators and allows mobile
devices to communicate with each other and telephones in the wider
public switched telephone network4g LET(PSTN). The architecture contains
specific features and functions which are needed because the phones are
not fixed in one location.</p>
<p>The NSS originally consisted of the circuit-switched core network, used
for traditional GSM services such as voice calls, SMS, and circuit
switched data calls. It was extended with an overlay architecture to
provide packet-switched data services known as the GPRS core network.
This allows mobile phones to have access to services such as WAP, MMS
and the Internet.<br />

<h2 id="ntp"><a class="header" href="#ntp">NTP</a></h2>
<p>Network Time Protocol</p>
<p>Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock
synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched,
variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is
one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by
David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.</p>
<p>NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a
few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).[1]:3 It uses the
intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo's algorithm, to
select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of
variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens
of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than
one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions.
Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or
more</p>

<p>Number Translation Service</p>
<p>A number translation service translates a dialled telephone number,
typically beginning 08 in the UK to a geographical 'connect number'
beginning 01 or 02 in the UK. The connect number may be changed without
changing the published dialled number. Originally NTS numbers were used,
for example, to allow any caller to dial a local call to the called
party irrespective of location, saving money if the connect number was
not also a local call, but the system gradually came to be seen as a way
of making money and now most phone companies charge the caller more for
08 numbers than for 01, 02 or 03 numbers.</p>
