<h2 id="ran"><a class="header" href="#ran">RAN</a></h2>
<p>radio access network</p>
<p>A radio access network (RAN) is part of a mobile telecommunication
system. It implements a radio access technology. Conceptually, it
resides between a device such as a mobile phone, a computer, or any
remotely controlled machine and provides connection with its core
network (CN). Depending on the standard, mobile phones and other
wireless connected devices are varyingly known as user equipment (UE),
terminal equipment, mobile station (MS), etc. RAN functionality is
typically provided by a silicon chip residing in both the core network
as well as the user equipment.</p>
<p>Examples of radio access network types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GRAN: GSM radio access network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GERAN: essentially the same as GRAN but specifying the inclusion of
EDGE packet radio services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTRAN: UMTS radio access network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E-UTRAN: The Long Term Evolution (LTE) high speed and low latency
radio access network</p>
<p>It is also possible for a single handset/phone to be simultaneously
connected to multiple radio access networks. Handsets capable of
this are sometimes called dual-mode handsets. For instance it is
common for handsets to support both GSM and UMTS (a.k.a. &quot;3G&quot;) radio
access technologies. Such devices seamlessly transfer an ongoing
call between different radio access networks without the user
noticing any disruption in service.<br />

<h2 id="ranap"><a class="header" href="#ranap">RANAP</a></h2>
<p>Radio Access Network Application Part</p>
<p>In telecommunications networks, RANAP (an acronym for Radio Access
Network Application Part) is a protocol specified by 3GPP in TS 25.413
and used in UMTS for signaling between the Core Network, which can be a
MSC or SGSN, and the UTRAN. RANAP is carried over Iu-interface.</p>
<p>RANAP signalling protocol resides in the control plane of Radio network
layer of Iu interface in the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication
System) protocol stack. Iu interface is the interface between RNC (Radio
Network Controller) and CN (Core Network). nb. For Iu-ps transport RANAP
is carried on SCTP if IP interface used on this.</p>
<p>RANAP handles signaling for the Iu-PS - RNC and 3G SGSN and Iu-CS - RNC
and 3G MSC . It also provides the signaling channel to transparently
pass messages between the User Equipment (UE) and the CN.</p>
<p>In LTE, RANAP has been replaced by S1AP.</p>

<h2 id="rarp"><a class="header" href="#rarp">RARP</a></h2>
<p>Dynamic IP Address Allocation -- Reverse Address Resolution protocol</p>
<p>The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is an obsolete computer
networking protocol used by a client computer to request its Internet
Protocol (IPv4) address from a computer network, when all it has
available is its link layer or hardware address, such as a MAC address.
The client broadcasts the request and does not need prior knowledge of
the network topology or the identities of servers capable of fulfilling
its request.</p>
<p>RARP is described in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) publication
RFC 903. It has been rendered obsolete by the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
and the modern Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which both
support a much greater feature set than RARP.</p>
<p>RARP requires one or more server hosts to maintain a database of
mappings of Link Layer addresses to their respective protocol addresses.
Media Access Control (MAC) addresses need to be individually configured
on the servers by an administrator. RARP is limited to serving only IP
addresses.</p>
<p>Reverse ARP differs from the Inverse Address Resolution Protocol (InARP)
described in RFC 2390, which is designed to obtain the IP address
associated with a local Frame Relay data link connection identifier.
InARP is not used in Ethernet.</p>
<p>Modern Day Uses<br />
Although the original uses for RARP have been overcome by different
protocols, some modern day protocols use RARP. Examples are:</p>
<p>Cisco's Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV). RARP is used to update
the layer 2 forwarding tables when a MAC address moves between data
centers.</p>

<h2 id="ras-1"><a class="header" href="#ras-1">RAS</a></h2>
<p>Registration, Admission, and Status</p>
<p>Registration, admission, and status (RAS) is a component of a network
protocol that involves the addition of (or refusal to add) new
authorized users, the admission of (or refusal to admit) authorized
users based on available bandwidth, and the tracking of the status of
all users. Formally, RAS is part of the H.225 protocol for H.323
communications networks, designed to support multimedia bandwidths. RAS
is an important signalling component in networks using voice over IP
(VoIP).</p>
<h2 id="rdbms"><a class="header" href="#rdbms">RDBMS</a></h2>
<p>relational database management system</p>
<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management
system (DBMS) based on the relational model invented by Edgar F. Codd at
IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. Most databases in widespread use
today are based on his relational database model.</p>
<p>RDBMSs have been a common choice for the storage of information in
databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical
information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s.
Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases
and network databases because they were easier to implement and
administer. Nonetheless, relational databases received continued,
unsuccessful challenges by object database management systems in the
1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the
so-called object-relational impedance mismatch between relational
databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by XML
database management systems in the 1990s. However, due to the expanse of
technologies, such as horizontal scaling of computer clusters, NoSQL
databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS
databases<br />

<h2 id="rdp"><a class="header" href="#rdp">RDP</a></h2>
<p>Remote Desktop Protocol</p>
<p>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by
Microsoft, which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect
to another computer over a network connection. The user employs RDP
client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP
server software.</p>
<p>Clients exist for most versions of Microsoft Windows (including Windows
Mobile), Linux, Unix, macOS, iOS, Android, and other operating systems.
RDP servers are built into Windows operating systems; an RDP server for
Unix and OS X also exists. By default, the server listens on TCP port
3389[1] and UDP port 3389.[2]</p>
<p>Microsoft currently refers to their official RDP client software as
Remote Desktop Connection, formerly &quot;Terminal Services Client&quot;.</p>
<p>The protocol is an extension of the ITU-T T.128 application sharing
protocol.</p>

<h2 id="rest"><a class="header" href="#rest">REST</a></h2>
<p>Representational State Transfer</p>
<p>Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that
defines a set of constraints and properties based on HTTP. Web Services
that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services,
provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.
REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and
manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform
and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of web services,
such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of
operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Web resources&quot; were first defined on the World Wide Web as documents or
files identified by their URLs. However, today they have a much more
generic and abstract definition that encompasses everything or entity
that can be identified, named, addressed, or handled, in any way
whatsoever, on the web. In a RESTful web service, requests made to a
resource's URI will elicit a response that may be in HTML, XML, JSON, or
some other format. The response may confirm that some alteration has
been made to the stored resource, and the response may provide hypertext
links to other related resources or collections of resources. When HTTP
is used, as is most common, the operations available are GET, POST, PUT,
DELETE, and other predefined CRUD HTTP methods.</p>
<p>By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, REST systems
aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow, by
re-using components that can be managed and updated without affecting
the system as a whole, even while it is running.</p>

<p>RF connector</p>
<p>A coaxial RF connector (radio frequency connector) is an electrical
connector designed to work at radio frequencies in the multi-megahertz
range. RF connectors are typically used with coaxial cables and are
designed to maintain the shielding that the coaxial design offers.
Better models also minimize the change in transmission line impedance at
the connection in order to reduce signal reflection and power loss. As
the frequency increases, transmission line effects become more
important, with small impedance variations from connectors causing the
signal to reflect rather than pass through. An RF connector must not
allow external signals into the circuit through electromagnetic
interference and capacitive pickup.</p>
<p>Mechanically, RF connectors may provide a fastening mechanism (thread,
bayonet, braces, blind mate) and springs for a low ohmic electric
contact while sparing the gold surface, thus allowing very high mating
cycles and reducing the insertion force. Research activity in the area
of radio-frequency (RF) circuit design has surged in the 2000s in direct
response to the enormous market demand for inexpensive, high-data-rate
wireless
transceivers. <img src="https://markbac.github.io/Glossary/plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-attachment" alt="" title="worddav5ace6a75721c51dcca734d64220d0cc9.png" /></p>

<p>Routing Information Protocol</p>
<p>The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest
distance-vector routing protocols which employ the hop count as a
routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on
the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The
largest number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of
networks that RIP can support.</p>
<p>RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown
mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being
propagated.</p>
<p>In RIPv1 router broadcast updates with their routing table every 30
seconds. In the early deployments, routing tables were small enough that
the traffic was not significant. As networks grew in size, however, it
became evident there could be a massive traffic burst every 30 seconds,
even if the routers had been initialized at random times.</p>
<p>In most networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice for
routing as its time to converge and scalability are poor compared to
EIGRP, OSPF, or IS-IS. However, it is easy to configure, because RIP
does not require any parameters unlike other protocols.</p>
<p>RIP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport protocol, and
is assigned the reserved port number 520.</p>

<p>A risk-reward analysis is a very simple tool which can help you assess
the risk and reward profile of completely different options. It works in
the same way as a risk-return analysis which you may already be familiar
with.<br />
It can be applied at any level, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>by a CEO for comparing different strategic directions for the
company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by a program manager deciding which projects to keep within the
program and which to discard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by a project manager deciding how to sequence tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or simply by an individual team member deciding how best to spend
their day.</p>
<p>The template works by having risk plotted along one axis and reward
along the other. In the diagram below I've divided the template into
four sections to show you how to interpret the information.</p>
<p><img src="./images/R/15008883.png?width=215" alt="" /><br />
The four categories from the diagram above are as follows:</p>
<p>Equal Low: where risk and reward are both proportional and low.<br />
Equal High: where risk and reward are both proportional and high.<br />
Positive: represents a positive risk-reward balance, where a higher
return can be achieved with limited risk.<br />
Negative: represents a negative risk-reward balance, where a low
return is the reward for taking on a relatively high risk.<br />
How to Use it<br />
First, you need to create a list of all the different options and
their possible rewards. This can done quickly and roughly, or can
involve serious effort (market research, scenario development etc)
-- the effort you put in will depend on the size of the decision you
are making. Examples of some options might include: outsourcing
non-core activities, stop investing in poorly performing product
lines, invest in new products, or investing to move into new
markets. Once you have all the options and their potential reward,
they should be plotted on the risk-reward chart:<br />
<img src="./images/R/15008889.png?width=262" alt="" /><br />
At this stage some options will appear to have a more favourable
risk-reward profile than others, such as outsourcing in the above
example, but it is work taking the time to investigate whether any
options can have their risks mitigated, or if there are options that
can have their rewards boosted, before making a final decision on
which option to go with. In the above example, if the risk of
developing new products could be mitigated somehow then that option
would become more favourable than outsourcing.</p>
<p>Finally, for an even more complete picture to further aid our
decision making, we can add resources to the risk-reward template.
In the diagram below, the bigger the bubble the more resources are
required to execute that option.<br />
<img src="./images/R/15008895.png?width=267" alt="" /><br />
With risk, reward, and resources all plotted, we are able to trade
them against one another to find the best option for us. From the
diagram above you can see that outsourcing is probably the most
favourable option, providing plenty of upside reward but requiring
minimal resource and having little risk. Additionally, with so few
resources engaged in making the outsourcing happen, perhaps some
investigative work can start on the new product development option
with some of the spare resource.</p>

<h2 id="rnc"><a class="header" href="#rnc">RNC</a></h2>
<p>Radio Network Controller</p>
<p>The Radio Network Controller (or RNC) is a governing element in the UMTS
radio access network (UTRAN) and is responsible for controlling the Node
Bs that are connected to it. The RNC carries out radio resource
management, some of the mobility management functions and is the point
where encryption is done before user data is sent to and from the
mobile. The RNC connects to the Circuit Switched Core Network through
Media Gateway (MGW) and to the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) in the
Packet Switched Core Network.<br />
Interfaces</p>
<p>RNC Interfaces<br />
The logical connections between the network elements are known as
interfaces. The interface between the RNC and the Circuit Switched Core
Network (CS-CN) is called Iu-CS and between the RNC and the Packet
Switched Core Network is called Iu-PS. Other interfaces include Iub
(between the RNC and the Node B) and Iur (between RNCs in the same
network). Iu interfaces carry user traffic (such as voice or data) as
well as control information (see Protocols), and Iur interface is mainly
needed for soft handovers involving 2 RNCs though not required as the
absence of Iur will cause these handovers to become hard handovers.<br />
<img src="./images/R/15008901.png?width=480" alt="" /></p>
<p>Protocols<br />
Iub, Iu and Iur protocols all carry both user data and signalling (that
is, control plane).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Signalling protocol responsible for the control of the Node B by the
RNC is called NBAP (Node-B Application Part). NBAP is subdivided
into Common and Dedicated NBAP (C-NBAP and D-NBAP), where Common
NBAP controls overall Node B functionality and Dedicated NBAP
controls separate cells or sectors of the Node B. NBAP is carried
over Iub. In order for NBAP to handle common and dedicated
procedures, it is divided into: NodeB Control Port (NCP) which
handles common NBAP procedures and Communication Control Port (CCP)
which handles dedicated NBAP procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control plane protocol for the transport layer is called ALCAP
(Access Link Control Application Protocol). Basic functionality of
ALCAP is multiplexing of different users onto one AAL2 transmission
path using channel IDs (CIDs). ALCAP is carried over Iub and Iu-CS
interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signalling protocol responsible for communication between RNC and
the core network is called RANAP (Radio Access Network Application
Part), and is carried over Iu interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signalling protocol responsible for communications between RNCs is
called RNSAP (Radio Network Subsystem Application Part) and is
carried on the Iur interface.</p>

Controllers defined in 3GPP specification TS 25.423.[1] It is carried
on the lur interface and provides functionality needed for soft
handovers and SRNS (Serving Radio Network Subsystem) relocation (handoff
between RNCs).It defines signalling between RNCs, including SRNC(Serving

<h2 id="round-robin"><a class="header" href="#round-robin">Round Robin</a></h2>
<p>Round-robin (RR) is one of the algorithms employed by process and
network schedulers in computing. As the term is generally used, time
slices (also known as time quanta) are assigned to each process in equal
portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority
(also known as cyclic executive). Round-robin scheduling is simple, easy
to implement, and starvation-free. Round-robin scheduling can also be
applied to other scheduling problems, such as data packet scheduling in
computer networks. It is an operating system concept.</p>
<p>The name of the algorithm comes from the round-robin principle known
from other fields, where each person takes an equal share of something
in turn.<br />
<img src="./images/R/15008907.png?width=545" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="router"><a class="header" href="#router">Router</a></h2>
<p>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between
computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on
the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or
email, is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded
from one router to another router through the networks that constitute
an internetwork until it reaches its destination node.</p>
<p>A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks.
When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the
network address information in the packet to determine the ultimate
destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing
policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.</p>
<p>The most familiar type of routers are home and small office routers that
simply forward IP packets between the home computers and the Internet.
An example of a router would be the owner's cable or DSL router, which
connects to the Internet through an Internet service provider (ISP).
More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, connect large
business or ISP networks up to the powerful core routers that forward
data at high speed along the optical fiber lines of the Internet
backbone. Though routers are typically dedicated hardware devices,
software-based routers also exist</p>
<h2 id="rpc"><a class="header" href="#rpc">RPC</a></h2>
<p>In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a
computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a
different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared
network), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call,
without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote
interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code
whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote.
This is a form of client--server interaction (caller is client, executor
is server), typically implemented via a request--response
message-passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPC
calls are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model
implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures
is largely the same whether it is local or remote, but usually they are
not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls.
Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable
than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.</p>
<p>RPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different
processes have different address spaces: if on the same host machine,
they have distinct virtual address spaces, even though the physical
address space is the same; while if they are on different hosts, the
physical address space is different. Many different (often incompatible)
technologies have been used to implement the concept.</p>
<h2 id="rrc"><a class="header" href="#rrc">RRC</a></h2>
<p>Radio Resource Control</p>
<p>The Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol is used in UMTS and LTE on the
Air interface. It is a layer that exists between UE and eNB and exists
at the IP level. This protocol is specified by 3GPP in TS 25.331 for
UMTS and in TS 36.331 for LTE. RRC messages are transported via the
PDCP-Protocol.</p>
<p>The major functions of the RRC protocol include connection establishment
and release functions, broadcast of system information, radio bearer
establishment, reconfiguration and release, RRC connection mobility
procedures, paging notification and release and outer loop power
control. By means of the signalling functions the RRC configures the
user and control planes according to the network status and allows for
Radio Resource Management strategies to be implemented.</p>
<p>The operation of the RRC is guided by a state machine which defines
certain specific states that a UE may be present in. The different
states in this state machine have different amounts of radio resources
associated with them and these are the resources that the UE may use
when it is present in a given specific state. Since different amounts of
resources are available at different states the quality of the service
that the user experiences and the energy consumption of the UE are
influenced by this state machine.</p>
<p>In order to comprehend the Radio Resource Control (RRC) state machine,
we should study the architecture of the third generation mobile cellular
system, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The UMTS
is composed by two subsystems, the UTRAN (Umts Terrestrial Radio Access
Network) and CN (core network) :<br />
<img src="./images/R/15008913.png?width=491" alt="" /></p>
<p>The RNC is responsible for the packet scheduling, radio resource control
and handover control.<br />
Unlike other wireless technologies like WIFI in which clients
concurrently send packets and collisions occur (and backoff algorithms),
in the UMTS there is a centralized entity that schedules resources to
each client. In order to manage the UE access to radio resources, the
UMTS introduces a radio resource control protocol (RRC) that attributes
each UE a specific state machine (based on radio resource usage). This
state machine is dependent on the 3G provider and can have different
states and/or transitions. According to the reference paper --
Characterizing Radio Resource Allocation for 3G Networks -- the studied
networks were composed by three states: IDLE, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH.<br />
In truth other states can actually be observed in some operators before
going into a disconnected mode. For example the PCH states -- URA_PCH
and CELL_PCH -- are states in which the user equipment has no transport
channels allocated but has to monitor the cell/UTRAN it is currently
connected to in order to send CELL_UPDATES to the RCN (just in case it
actually changes). This update implies temporarily changing the state to
a CELL_FACH in order to be able to send data. The change from
CELL_PCH, in which the UE is known at a cell level, to URA_PCH, in
which the user is known at UTRAN level, may be due to an increasing
number of CELL_UPDATES (e.g. travelling fast). This is useful in order
to speed up incoming connections since it might take around 0.9 seconds
to establish it against the 2.5s delay if the UE is on the IDLE state.<br />
Below is a diagram that represents the six most common states --
CELL_DCH, CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH, IDLE, DISCONNECT -- and some
of the possible transitions.<br />

<p>Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol</p>
<p>In 2001, the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) as
802.1w. RSTP provides significantly faster spanning tree convergence
after a topology change, introducing new convergence behaviors and
bridge port roles to do this. RSTP was designed to be
backwards-compatible with standard STP.</p>
<p>While STP can take 30 to 50 seconds to respond to a topology change,
RSTP is typically able to respond to changes within 3 × Hello times
(default: 3 times 2 seconds) or within a few milliseconds of a physical
link failure. The Hello time is an important and configurable time
interval that is used by RSTP for several purposes; its default value is
2 seconds.</p>
<p>Standard IEEE 802.1D-2004 incorporates RSTP and obsoletes the original
STP standard.</p>
<h2 id="rsvp"><a class="header" href="#rsvp">RSVP</a></h2>
<p>Resource Reservation Protocol</p>
<p>The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is a transport layer protocol
designed to reserve resources across a network for quality of service
(QoS) using the integrated services model. RSVP operates over an IPv4 or
IPv6 and provides receiver-initiated setup of resource reservations for
multicast or unicast data flows. It does not transport application data
but is similar to a control protocol, like Internet Control Message
Protocol (ICMP) or Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). RSVP is
described in RFC 2205.</p>
<p>RSVP can be used by hosts and routers to request or deliver specific
levels of QoS for application data streams or flows. RSVP defines how
applications place reservations and how they can relinquish the reserved
resources once no longer required. RSVP operation will generally result
in resources being reserved in each node along a path. RSVP is not a
routing protocol and was designed to interoperate with current and
future routing protocols.</p>
<p>RSVP by itself is rarely deployed in telecommunications networks
today[citation needed] but, as of February 2003, the traffic
engineering extension of RSVP, or RSVP-TE, is becoming more widely
accepted nowadays in many QoS-oriented networks. Next Steps in Signaling
(NSIS) is a proposed replacement for RSVP.</p>
<h2 id="rtcp"><a class="header" href="#rtcp">RTCP</a></h2>
<p>Real-Time Control Protocol</p>
<p>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is a sister protocol of the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP). Its basic functionality and packet structure
is defined in RFC 3550. RTCP provides out-of-band statistics and control
information for an RTP session. It partners with RTP in the delivery and
packaging of multimedia data, but does not transport any media data
itself.</p>
<p>The primary function of RTCP is to provide feedback on the quality of
service (QoS) in media distribution by periodically sending statistics
information such as transmitted octet and packet counts, packet loss,
packet delay variation, and round-trip delay time to participants in a
streaming multimedia session. An application may use this information to
control quality of service parameters, perhaps by limiting flow, or
using a different codec.</p>
<h2 id="rtos"><a class="header" href="#rtos">RTOS</a></h2>
<p>A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS) intended
to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in,
typically without buffer delays. Processing time requirements (including
any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of
time. A real time system is a time bound system which has well defined
fixed time constraints. Processing must be done within the defined
constraints or the system will fail. They either are event driven or
time sharing. Event driven systems switch between tasks based on their
priorities while time sharing systems switch the task based on clock
interrupts. Most RTOS's use a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.</p>
<p>A key characteristic of an RTOS is the level of its consistency
concerning the amount of time it takes to accept and complete an
application's task; the variability is jitter. A hard real-time
operating system has less jitter than a soft real-time operating system.
The chief design goal is not high throughput, but rather a guarantee of
a soft or hard performance category. An RTOS that can usually or
generally meet a deadline is a soft real-time OS, but if it can meet a
deadline deterministically it is a hard real-time OS.</p>
<p>An RTOS has an advanced algorithm for scheduling. Scheduler flexibility
enables a wider, computer-system orchestration of process priorities,
but a real-time OS is more frequently dedicated to a narrow set of
applications. Key factors in a real-time OS are minimal interrupt
latency and minimal thread switching latency; a real-time OS is valued
more for how quickly or how predictably it can respond than for the
amount of work it can perform in a given period of time.</p>
<h2 id="rtp"><a class="header" href="#rtp">RTP</a></h2>
<p>Real-time Protocol</p>
<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a network protocol for
delivering audio and video over IP networks. RTP is used extensively in
communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media,
such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC,
television services and web-based push-to-talk features.</p>
<p>RTP typically runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). RTP is used in
conjunction with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). While RTP carries the
media streams (e.g., audio and video), RTCP is used to monitor
transmission statistics and quality of service (QoS) and aids
synchronization of multiple streams. RTP is one of the technical
foundations of Voice over IP and in this context is often used in
conjunction with a signalling protocol such as the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) which establishes connections across the network.</p>
<h2 id="rtsp"><a class="header" href="#rtsp">RTSP</a></h2>
<p>Real Time Streaming Protocol</p>
<p>The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol
designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control
streaming media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and
controlling media sessions between end points. Clients of media servers
issue VCR-style commands, such as play, record and pause, to facilitate
