<p>.NET Framework (pronounced dot net) is a software framework developed by
Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a
large class library named Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides
language interoperability (each language can use code written in other
languages) across several programming languages. Programs
written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in
contrast to a hardware environment) named Common Language Runtime (CLR),
an application virtual machine that provides services such as security,
memory management, and exception handling. (As such, computer code
written using .NET Framework is called &quot;managed code&quot;.) FCL and CLR
together constitute .NET Framework.</p>
<p>FCL provides user interface, data access, database connectivity,
cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, and
network communications. Programmers produce software by combining their
source code with .NET Framework and other libraries. The framework is
intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows
platform. Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment
largely for .NET software called Visual Studio.</p>

<p>In computer networking, Fast Ethernet physical layers carry traffic at
the nominal rate of 100 Mbit/s. The prior Ethernet speed was 10 Mbit/s.
Of the Fast Ethernet physical layers, 100BASE-TX is by far the most
common.</p>
<p>Fast Ethernet was introduced in 1995 as the IEEE 802.3u standard
and remained the fastest version of Ethernet for three years before the
introduction of Gigabit Ethernet. The acronym GE/FE is sometimes used
for devices supporting both standards</p>

<p>5ESS Switching System</p>
<p>The 5ESS Switching System is a telephone electronic switching system
developed by Western Electric for the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company (AT&amp;T) and the Bell System in the United States.</p>
<p>The 5ESS came to market as the Western Electric No. 5 ESS. It first
commenced service in Seneca, Illinois on 25 March 1982, and was destined
to replace the Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS and 1AESS)
and other electromechanical systems in the 1980s and 1990s. The 5ESS was
also used as a Class 4 telephone switch or as a hybrid Class 4/Class 5
switch in markets too small for the 4ESS. Approximately half of all US
central offices are served by 5ESS switches. The 5ESS is also exported
internationally, and manufactured outside the US under license.</p>
<p>The 5ESS technology was transferred to the AT&amp;T Network Systems division
upon the breakup of the Bell System. The division was divested by AT&amp;T
as Lucent Technologies, and after becoming Alcatel-Lucent, it was
acquired by Nokia.</p>
<p>The 5ESS switch has three main types of modules: the Administrative
Module (AM) contains the central computers; the Communications Module
(CM) is the central time-divided switch of the system; and the Switching
Module (SM) makes up the majority of the equipment in most exchanges.
The SM performs multiplexing, analog and digital coding, and other work
to interface with external equipment. Each has a controller, a small
computer with duplicated CPUs and memories, like most common equipment
of the exchange, for redundancy. Distributed systems lessen the load on
the Central Administrative Module (AM) or main computer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="5g"><a class="header" href="#5g">5G</a></h1>
<p>5G is a marketing term for some new mobile technologies. Definitions
differ and confusion is common. The ITU IMT-2020 standard provides for
speeds up to 20 gigabits per second and has only been demonstrated with
millimeter waves of 15 gigahertz and higher frequency. The more recent
3GPP standard includes any network using the NR New Radio software. 5G
New Radio can include lower frequencies, from 600 MHz to 6 GHz. However,
the speeds in these lower frequencies are only modestly higher than new
4G systems, estimated at 15% to 50% faster. At least at the lower
frequencies, &quot;5G is evolutionary.&quot;</p>

<p>EEE 802.11 is part of the IEEE 802 set of local area network (LAN)
technical standards, and specifies the set of media access control (MAC)
and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless local area
network (WLAN) computer communication. The standard and amendments
provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand
and are the world's most widely used wireless computer networking
standards. IEEE 802.11 is used in most home and office networks to allow
laptops, printers, smartphones, and other devices to communicate with
each other and access the Internet without connecting wires.</p>
<p>The standards are created and maintained by the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802).
The base version of the standard was released in 1997 and has had
subsequent amendments. While each amendment is officially revoked when
it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate
world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote the
capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each
revision tends to become its own standard.</p>
<p>IEEE 802.11 uses various frequencies including, but not limited to, 2.4
GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, and 60 GHz frequency bands. Although IEEE 802.11
specifications list channels that might be used, the radio frequency
spectrum availability allowed varies significantly by regulatory domain.</p>
<p>The protocols are typically used in conjunction with IEEE 802.2, and are
designed to interwork seamlessly with Ethernet, and are very often used
to carry Internet Protocol traffic.</p>

defining the physical layer and data link layer's media access control
(MAC) of wired Ethernet. This is generally a local area network (LAN)
technology with some wide area network (WAN) applications. Physical
connections are made between nodes and/or infrastructure devices (hubs,
switches, routers) by various types of copper or fiber cable.</p>
<p>802.3 is a technology that supports the IEEE 802.1 network architecture.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aac"><a class="header" href="#aac">AAC</a></h1>
<p>Advanced Audio Coding</p>
<p>Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a proprietary audio coding standard for
lossy digital audio compression. Designed to be the successor of the MP3
format, AAC generally achieves better sound quality than MP3 at the same
bit rate. The confusingly named AAC+ (HE-AAC) does so only at low bit
rates and less so at high ones.</p>
<p>AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC, as part of the MPEG-2 and
MPEG-4 specifications. Part of AAC, HE-AAC (AAC+), is part of MPEG-4
Audio and also adopted into digital radio standards DAB+ and Digital
Radio Mondiale, as well as mobile television standards DVB-H and
ATSC-M/H.</p>
<p>AAC supports inclusion of 48 full-bandwidth (up to 96 kHz) audio
channels in one stream plus 16 low frequency effects (LFE, limited to
120 Hz) channels, up to 16 &quot;coupling&quot; or dialog channels, and up to 16
data streams. The quality for stereo is satisfactory to modest
requirements at 96 kbit/s in joint stereo mode; however, hi-fi
transparency demands data rates of at least 128 kbit/s (VBR). Tests of
MPEG-4 audio have shown that AAC meets the requirements referred to as
&quot;transparent&quot; for the ITU at 128 kbit/s for stereo, and 320 kbit/s for
5.1 audio.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aal1"><a class="header" href="#aal1">AAL1</a></h1>
<p>An ATM Adaptation layer 1 or AAL1 is used for transmitting Class A
network traffic, that is, real-time, constant bit rate, connection
oriented traffic (example- uncompressed audio and video). Bits are fed
in by the application at constant rate and must be delivered to other
end with minimum delay, jitter or overhead. The input is stream of bits
without message boundaries. For this traffic, error detection protocols
cannot be used since timeouts and retransmission causes delay but the
missing cells are reported to the application, that must take its own
action to recover from them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aal2"><a class="header" href="#aal2">AAL2</a></h1>
<p>ATM Adaptation Layer 2</p>
<p>ATM Adaptation Layer 2 (AAL2) is an ATM adaptation layer for
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), used primarily in telecommunications;
for example, it is used for the Iu interfaces in the Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System, and is also used for transporting digital
voice. The standard specifications related to AAL2 are ITU standards
I.363.2 and I366.1.</p>
<p>What is AAL2?<br />
AAL2 is a variable bitrate, connection-oriented, low latency service
originally intended to adapt voice for transmission over ATM. Like other
ATM adaptation layers, AAL2 defines segmentation and reassembly of
higher-layer packets into ATM cells, in this case packets of data
containing voice and control information. AAL2 is further separated into
two sub-layers that help with the mapping from upper layer services to
ATM cells. These are named Service Specific Convergence Sub-layer (SSCS)
and Common Part Sub-layer (CPS).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aal5"><a class="header" href="#aal5">AAL5</a></h1>
<p>ATM Adaptation Layer 5</p>
<p>ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) is an ATM adaptation layer used to send
variable-length packets up to 65,535 octets in size across an
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network.</p>
<p>Unlike most network frames, which place control information in the
header, AAL5 places control information in an 8-octet trailer at the end
of the packet. The AAL5 trailer contains a 16-bit length field, a 32-bit
cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and two 8-bit fields labeled UU and CPI
that are currently unused.</p>
<p>Each AAL5 packet is divided into an integral number of ATM cells and
reassembled into a packet before delivery to the receiving host. This
process is known as Segmentation and Reassembly (see below). The last
cell contains padding to ensure that the entire packet is a multiple of
48 octets long. The final cell contains up to 40 octets of data,
followed by padding bytes and the 8-octet trailer. In other words, AAL5
places the trailer in the last 8 octets of the final cell where it can
be found without knowing the length of the packet; the final cell is
identified by a bit in the ATM header (see below), and the trailer is
always in the last 8 octets of that cell.</p>

<p>Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop</p>
<p>Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) is a type of digital
subscriber line (DSL) technology, a data communications technology that
enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a
conventional voiceband modem can provide. ADSL differs from the less
common symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL). In ADSL, bandwidth and
bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer
premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). Providers usually
market ADSL as a service for consumers for Internet access for primarily
downloading content from the Internet, but not serving content accessed
by others.<br />

<p>Active Directory</p>
<p>Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed
for the Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server
operating systems as a set of processes and services. Initially, Active
Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management. Starting
with Windows Server 2008, however, Active Directory became an umbrella
title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.</p>
<p>A server running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is called a
domain controller. It authenticates and authorizes all users and
computers in a Windows domain type network---assigning and enforcing
security policies for all computers and installing or updating software.
For example, when a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows
domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines
whether the user is a system administrator or normal user. Also, it
allows management and storage of information, provides authentication
and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy
other related services: Certificate Services, Federated Services,
Lightweight Directory Services and Rights Management Services.</p>
<p>Active Directory uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version of Kerberos, and DNS.</p>

<p>Advanced Encryption Standard</p>
<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name
Rijndael is a specification for the encryption of electronic data
established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in 2001.</p>
<p>AES is a subset of the Rijndael block cipher developed by two Belgian
cryptographers, Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen, who submitted a
proposal[5] to NIST during the AES selection process.[6] Rijndael is
a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes.</p>
<p>For AES, NIST selected three members of the Rijndael family, each with a
block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192 and
256 bits.</p>
<p>AES has been adopted by the U.S. government and is now used worldwide.
It supersedes the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was published in
1977. The algorithm described by AES is a symmetric-key algorithm,
meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the
data.</p>
<p>In the United States, AES was announced by the NIST as U.S. FIPS PUB 197
(FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001. This announcement followed a five-year
standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were
presented and evaluated, before the Rijndael cipher was selected as the
most suitable (see Advanced Encryption Standard process for more
details).</p>
<p>AES became effective as a federal government standard on May 26, 2002,
after approval by the Secretary of Commerce. AES is included in the
ISO/IEC 18033-3 standard. AES is available in many different encryption
packages, and is the first (and only) publicly accessible cipher
approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for top secret
information when used in an NSA approved cryptographic module</p>

<p>Alarm Indication Signaling</p>
<p>Alarm indication signal (AIS) (also called &quot;all ones&quot; because of the
data and framing pattern) is a signal transmitted by an intermediate
element of a multi-node transport circuit that is part of a concatenated
telecommunications system to alert the receiving end of the circuit that
a segment of the end-to-end link has failed at a logical or physical
level, even if the system it is directly connected to is still working.
The AIS replaces the failed data, allowing the higher order system in
the concatenation to maintain its transmission framing integrity.
Downstream intermediate elements of the transport circuit propagate the
AIS onwards to the destination element.</p>

is defined by 3GPP as equivalent of ITU recommendation Q.2630.2. Basic
functionality of ALCAP is multiplexing of different users onto one AAL2
transmission path using channel IDs (CIDs). It is used in the UMTS
access network UTRAN along with ATM, while IPBCP is use for IP links in
the core of the network.</p>
<p>ALCAP makes it possible for up to 248 channels to be multiplexed onto

<p>Asymmetric Multiprocessing</p>
<p>In an asymmetric multiprocessing system (AMP), not all CPUs are treated
equally; for example, a system might allow (either at the hardware or
operating system level) only one CPU to execute operating system code or
might allow only one CPU to perform I/O operations. Other AMP systems
would allow any CPU to execute operating system code and perform I/O
operations, so that they were symmetric with regard to processor roles,
but attached some or all peripherals to particular CPUs, so that they
were asymmetric with respect to the peripheral attachment. Asymmetric
multiprocessing was the only method for handling multiple CPUs before
symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) was available. It has also been used to
provide less expensive options on systems where SMP was available.
Additionally, AMP is used in applications that are dedicated, such as
embedded systems, when individual processors can be dedicated to
specific tasks at design time.</p>
<p>Multiprocessing is the use of more than one CPU in a computer system.
The CPU is the arithmetic and logic engine that executes user
applications. With multiple CPUs, more than one set of program
instructions can be executed at the same time. All of the CPUs have the
same user-mode instruction set, so a running job can be rescheduled from
one CPU to another.</p>

<p>Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrow band</p>
<p>The Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR, AMR-NB or GSM-AMR) audio codec is an audio

consists of a multi-rate narrowband speech codec that encodes narrowband
(200--3400 Hz) signals at variable bit rates ranging from 4.75 to 12.2
kbit/s with toll quality speech starting at 7.4 kbit/s.</p>
<p>AMR was adopted as the standard speech codec by 3GPP in October 1999 and

<p>Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband</p>
<p>Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) is a patented wideband speech
audio coding standard developed based on Adaptive Multi-Rate encoding,
using similar methodology as algebraic code excited linear prediction
(ACELP). AMR-WB provides improved speech quality due to a wider speech
bandwidth of 50--7000 Hz compared to narrowband speech coders which in
general are optimized for POTS wireline quality of 300--3400 Hz. AMR-WB
was developed by Nokia and VoiceAge and it was first specified by 3GPP.</p>
<p>AMR-WB is codified as G.722.2, an ITU-T standard speech codec, formally
known as Wideband coding of speech at around 16 kbit/s using Adaptive
Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB). G.722.2 AMR-WB is the same codec as the
3GPP AMR-WB. The corresponding 3GPP specifications are TS 26.190 for the
speech codec and TS 26.194 for the Voice Activity Detector.</p>
<p>The AMR-WB format has the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency bands processed: 50-6400 Hz (all modes) plus 6400-7000 Hz
(23.85 kbit/s mode only)</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aop"><a class="header" href="#aop">AOP</a></h1>
<p>aspect-oriented programming</p>
<p>In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming
paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of
cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to
existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself, instead
separately specifying which code is modified via a &quot;pointcut&quot;
specification, such as &quot;log all function calls when the function's name
begins with 'set'&quot;. This allows behaviors that are not central to the
business logic (such as logging) to be added to a program without
cluttering the code, core to the functionality. AOP forms a basis for
aspect-oriented software development.</p>
<p>AOP includes programming methods and tools that support the
modularization of concerns at the level of the source code, while
&quot;aspect-oriented software development&quot; refers to a whole engineering
discipline.</p>
<p>Aspect-oriented programming entails breaking down program logic into
distinct parts (so-called concerns, cohesive areas of functionality).
Nearly all programming paradigms support some level of grouping and
encapsulation of concerns into separate, independent entities by
providing abstractions (e.g., functions, procedures, modules, classes,
methods) that can be used for implementing, abstracting and composing
these concerns. Some concerns &quot;cut across&quot; multiple abstractions in a
program, and defy these forms of implementation. These concerns are
called cross-cutting concerns or horizontal concerns.</p>
<p>Logging exemplifies a crosscutting concern because a logging strategy
necessarily affects every logged part of the system. Logging thereby
crosscuts all logged classes and methods.</p>
<p>All AOP implementations have some crosscutting expressions that
encapsulate each concern in one place. The difference between
implementations lies in the power, safety, and usability of the
constructs provided. For example, interceptors that specify the methods
to intercept express a limited form of crosscutting, without much
support for type-safety or debugging. AspectJ has a number of such
expressions and encapsulates them in a special class, an aspect. For
example, an aspect can alter the behavior of the base code (the
non-aspect part of a program) by applying advice (additional behavior)
at various join points (points in a program) specified in a
quantification or query called a pointcut (that detects whether a given
join point matches). An aspect can also make binary-compatible
structural changes to other classes, like adding members or parents.</p>

<p>Access Point Name</p>
<p>An Access Point Name (APN) is the name of a gateway between a GSM, GPRS,
3G or 4G mobile network and another computer network, frequently the
public Internet.</p>
<p>A mobile device making a data connection must be configured with an APN
to present to the carrier. The carrier will then examine this identifier
to determine what type of network connection should be created, for
example: which IP addresses should be assigned to the wireless device,
which security methods should be used, and how or if, it should be
connected to some private customer network.</p>
<p>More specifically, the APN identifies the packet data network (PDN) that
a mobile data user wants to communicate with. In addition to identifying
a PDN, an APN may also be used to define the type of service,
(e.g. connection to Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) server,
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)) that is provided by the PDN. APN is
used in 3GPP data access networks, e.g. General Packet Radio Service
(GPRS), evolved packet core (EPC).</p>

<p>In computer networking, ARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, or ARP poison
routing, is a technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network. Generally,
the aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address
of another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant
for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.</p>
<p>ARP spoofing may allow an attacker to intercept data frames on a
network, modify the traffic, or stop all traffic. Often the attack is
used as an opening for other attacks, such as denial of service, man in
the middle, or session hijacking attacks.</p>
<p>The attack can only be used on networks that use ARP, and requires
attacker have direct access to the local network segment to be attacked<br />

<p>Protocol developers define data structures in ASN.1 modules, which are
generally a section of a broader standards document written in the ASN.1
language. Because the language is both human-readable and
machine-readable, modules can be automatically turned into libraries

<p>ASN.1 is similar in purpose and use to protocol buffers and Apache
Thrift, which are also interface description
languages for cross-platform data serialization. Like those languages,
it has a schema (in ASN.1, called a &quot;module&quot;), and a set of encodings,
typically type-length-value encodings. However, ASN.1, defined in 1984,
predates them by many years. It also includes a wider variety of basic
data types, some of which are obsolete, and has more
options for extensibility. A single ASN.1 message can include data from
multiple modules defined in multiple standards, even standards defined

reference model for ATM approximately maps to the three lowest layers of
the ISO-OSI reference model: network layer, data link layer, and
physical layer.[3] ATM is a core protocol used over the SONET/SDH
backbone of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Integrated

available all the time, through the Internet. AWS's version of virtual
computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer including
hardware (CPU(s) &amp; GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory,
hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and
pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, CRM,
etc. Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I/O (keyboard,
display, and mouse), allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS
system using a modern browser. The browser acts as a window into the
virtual computer, letting subscribers log-in, configure and use their
virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer. They can
choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet-based services
for themselves and their customers.</p>
<p>The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world,
and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination
of usage, the hardware/OS/software/networking features chosen by the
subscriber, required availability, redundancy, security, and service
options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a
dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. As part of the

<p>An audio coding format (or sometimes audio compression format) is a
content representation format for storage or transmission of digital
audio (such as in digital television, digital radio and in audio and
video files). Examples of audio coding formats include MP3, AAC, Vorbis,
FLAC, and Opus. A specific software or hardware implementation capable
of audio compression and decompression to/from a specific audio coding
format is called an audio codec; an example of an audio codec is LAME,
which is one of several different codecs which implements encoding and
decoding audio in the MP3 audio coding format in software.</p>
<p>Some audio coding formats are documented by a detailed technical
specification document known as an audio coding specification. Some such
specifications are written and approved by standardization organizations
as technical standards, and are thus known as an audio coding standard.
The term &quot;standard&quot; is also sometimes used for de facto standards as
well as formal standards.</p>
<p>Audio content encoded in a particular audio coding format is normally
encapsulated within a container format. As such, the user normally
doesn't have a raw AAC file, but instead has a .m4a audio file, which is
a MPEG-4 Part 14 container containing AAC-encoded audio. The container
also contains metadata such as title and other tags, and perhaps an
index for fast seeking. A notable exception is MP3 files, which are raw
audio coding without a container format. De facto standards for adding
metadata tags such as title and artist to MP3s, such as ID3, are hacks
which work by appending the tags to the MP3, and then relying on the MP3
player to recognize the chunk as malformed audio coding and therefore
skip it. In video files with audio, the encoded audio content is bundled
with video (in a video coding format) inside a multimedia container
format.</p>
<p>An audio coding format does not dictate all algorithms used by a codec
implementing the format. An important part of how lossy audio
compression works is by removing data in ways humans can't hear,
according to a psychoacoustic model; the implementer of an encoder has
some freedom of choice in which data to remove (according to their
psychoacoustic model).<br />

<p>business-to-business</p>
<p>Business-to-business (B2B or, in some countries, BtoB) refers to a
situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with
another. This typically occurs when:</p>
<p>A business is sourcing materials for their production process (e.g. a
food manufacturer purchasing salt).<br />
A business needs the services of another for operational reasons (e.g. a
food manufacturer employing an accountancy firm to audit their
finances).<br />
A business re-sells goods and services produced by others (e.g. a
retailer buying the end product from the food manufacturer).<br />
B2B is often contrasted with business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B
commerce, it is often the case that the parties to the relationship have
comparable negotiating power, and even when they do not, each party
typically involves professional staff and legal counsel in the
negotiation of terms, whereas B2C is shaped to a far greater degree by
economic implications of information asymmetry. However, within a B2B
context, large companies may have many commercial, resource and
information advantages over smaller businesses.</p>

<p>business-to-consumer</p>
<p>Business to consumer (B2C) refers to the transactions conducted directly
between a company and consumers who are the end-users of its products or
services. The business to consumer as a business model differs
significantly from the business-to-business model, which refers to
commerce between two or more businesses. While most companies that sell
directly to consumers can be referred to as B2C companies, the term
became immensely popular during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when
it was used mainly to refer to online retailers, as well as other
companies that sold products and services to consumers through the
internet.</p>

<p>Basic Encoding Rules</p>
<p>The format for Basic Encoding Rules specifies a self-describing and

element is encoded as a type identifier, a length description, the
actual data elements, and, where necessary, an end-of-content marker.
These types of encodings are commonly called type-length-value or TLV
encodings. This format allows a receiver to decode the ASN.1 information
from an incomplete stream, without requiring any pre-knowledge of the
size, content, or semantic meaning of the data.</p>

<p>Broadband Network Gateway</p>
<p>The Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) allows subscribers to connect to a
broadband network through an access portal. It creates and manages
subscriber sessions, aggregating traffic from various subscriber
sessions from an access network, and routing it to the network of the
Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Network Service Provider (NSP).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bootp"><a class="header" href="#bootp">BOOTP</a></h1>
<p>Dynamic IP Address Allocation -- Bootstrap protocol</p>
<p>The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a computer networking protocol used in
Internet Protocol networks to automatically assign an IP address to
network devices from a configuration server. The BOOTP was originally
defined in RFC 951.</p>
<p>When a computer that is connected to a network is powered up and boots
its operating system, the system software broadcasts BOOTP messages onto
the network to request an IP address assignment. A BOOTP configuration
server assigns an IP address based on the request from a pool of
addresses configured by an administrator.</p>
<p>BOOTP is implemented using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as transport
protocol, port number 67 is used by the (DHCP) server to receive client
requests and port number 68 is used by the client to receive (DHCP)
server responses. BOOTP operates only on IPv4 networks.</p>
<p>Historically, BOOTP has also been used for Unix-like diskless
workstations to obtain the network location of their boot image, in
addition to the IP address assignment. Enterprises used it to roll out a
pre-configured client (e.g., Windows) installation to newly installed
PCs.</p>

<p>BPEL is often associated with Business Process Management Notation
(BPMN), a standard for representing business processes graphically. In
many organizations, analysts use BPMN to visualize business processes
and developers transform the visualizations to BPEL for execution.</p>
<p>BPEL was standardized by OASIS in 2004 after collaborative efforts to

<p>Basic Rate Interface</p>
<p>Basic Rate Interface (BRI, 2B+D, 2B1D) or Basic Rate Access is an
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) configuration intended
primarily for use in subscriber lines similar to those that have long
been used for voice-grade telephone service. As such, an ISDN BRI
connection can use the existing telephone infrastructure at a business.</p>
<p>The BRI configuration provides 2 data (bearer) channels (B channels) at
64 kbit/s each and 1 control (delta) channel (D channel) at 16 kbit/s.
The B channels are used for voice or user data, and the D channel is
used for any combination of data, control/signaling, and X.25 packet
networking. The 2 B channels can be aggregated by channel bonding
providing a total data rate of 128 kbit/s. The BRI ISDN service is
commonly installed for residential or small business service (ISDN PABX)
in many countries.</p>
<p>In contrast to the BRI, the Primary Rate Interface (PRI) configuration
provides more B channels and operates at a higher bit rate.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bsc"><a class="header" href="#bsc">BSC</a></h1>
<p>The base station controller (BSC) provides, classically, the
intelligence behind the BTSs. Typically a BSC has tens or even hundreds
of BTSs under its control. The BSC handles allocation of radio channels,
receives measurements from the mobile phones, and controls handovers
from BTS to BTS (except in the case of an inter-BSC handover in which
case control is in part the responsibility of the anchor MSC). A key
function of the BSC is to act as a concentrator where many different low
capacity connections to BTSs (with relatively low utilisation) become
reduced to a smaller number of connections towards the mobile switching
center (MSC) (with a high level of utilisation). Overall, this means
that networks are often structured to have many BSCs distributed into
regions near their BTSs which are then connected to large centralised
MSC sites.</p>
<p>The BSC is undoubtedly the most robust element in the BSS as it is not
only a BTS controller but, for some vendors, a full switching center, as
well as an SS7 node with connections to the MSC and serving GPRS support
node (SGSN) (when using GPRS). It also provides all the required data to
the operation support subsystem (OSS) as well as to the performance
measuring centers.</p>
<p>A BSC is often based on a distributed computing architecture, with
redundancy applied to critical functional units to ensure availability
in the event of fault conditions. Redundancy often extends beyond the
BSC equipment itself and is commonly used in the power supplies and in
the transmission equipment providing the A-ter interface to PCU.<br />

<p>In a hierarchical telecommunications network the backhaul portion of the
network comprises the intermediate links between the core network, or
backbone network, and the small subnetworks at the &quot;edge&quot; of the entire
hierarchical network.</p>
<p>In contracts pertaining to such networks, backhaul is the obligation to
carry packets to and from that global network. A non-technical business
definition of backhaul is the commercial wholesale bandwidth provider
who offers quality of service (QOS) guarantees to the retailer. It
appears most often in telecommunications trade literature in this sense,
whereby the backhaul connection is defined not technically but by who
operates and manages it, and who takes legal responsibility for the
connection or uptime to the Internet or 3G/4G network. See also hotspot
contracts below.</p>
<p>In both the technical and commercial definitions, backhaul generally
refers to the side of the network that communicates with the global
Internet, paid for at wholesale commercial access rates to or at an
Ethernet Exchange or other core network access location. Sometimes
middle mile networks exist between the customer's own LAN and those
exchanges. This can be a local WAN or WLAN connection, for instance
Network New Hampshire Now and Maine Fiber Company run tariffed public
dark fiber networks as a backhaul alternative to encourage local and
national carriers to reach areas with broadband and cell phone that they
otherwise would not be serving. These serve retail networks which in

<p>Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over
short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band
from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building
personal area networks (PANs). Invented by Dutch electrical engineer
Jaap Haartsen, working for telecom vendor Ericsson in 1994, it was
originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG),
which has more than 30,000 member companies in the areas of
telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics. The
IEEE standardized Bluetooth as IEEE 802.15.1, but no longer maintains
the standard.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="c-language"><a class="header" href="#c-language">C Language</a></h1>
<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language,
supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion,
while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By
design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine
instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications
that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating
systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging
from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
<p>C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at
Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has
since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all
time, with C compilers from various vendors available for the
majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has
been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
<p>C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled
using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access
to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to
machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Despite
its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage
cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C
program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms
and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language
has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded
microcontrollers to supercomputers.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="c-2"><a class="header" href="#c-2">C++</a></h1>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative,
object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing
facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
<p>It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded,
resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and
flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found
useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software
infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop
applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL servers), and
performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space
probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it
available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers,
including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.</p>
<p>C++ is standardized by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version
ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017
(informally known as C+17). The C+ programming language was initially
standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by
the C+03, C11 and C14 standards. The current C17 standard supersedes
these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the
initial standardization in 1998, C+ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup
at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he wanted
an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided
high-level features for program organization. C++20 is the next planned
standard thereafter.</p>

<p>Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic</p>
<p>Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) is a
set of standards designed to work on either a GSM core network or the
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network. The framework
provides tools for operators to define additional features for standard
GSM services/UMTS services. The CAMEL architecture is based on the
Intelligent Network (IN) standards, and uses the CAP protocol. The
protocols are codified in a series of ETSI Technical Specifications.</p>
<p>Many services can be created using CAMEL, and it is particularly
effective in allowing these services to be offered when a subscriber is
roaming, like, for instance, no-prefix dialing (the number the user
dials is the same no matter the country where the call is placed) or
seamless MMS message access from abroad.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cap"><a class="header" href="#cap">CAP</a></h1>
<p>CAMEL Application Part</p>
<p>The CAMEL Application Part (CAP) is a signalling protocol used in the
Intelligent Network (IN) architecture. CAP is a Remote Operations
Service Element (ROSE) user protocol, and as such is layered on top of
the Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) of the SS#7
protocol suite. CAP is based on a subset of the ETSI Core and allows for
the implementation of carrier-grade, value added services such as
unified messaging, prepaid, fraud control and Freephone in both the GSM
voice and GPRS data networks. CAMEL is a means of adding intelligent
applications to mobile (rather than fixed) networks. It builds upon
established practices in the fixed line telephony business that are
generally classed under the heading of (Intelligent Network Application
Part) or INAP CS-2 protocol</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ca"><a class="header" href="#ca">CA</a></h1>
<p>Certificate Authority</p>
<p>In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA)
is an entity that issues digital certificates. A digital certificate
certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the
certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon
signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds
to the certified public key. A CA acts as a trusted third
party---trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by
the party relying upon the certificate. The format of these certificates
is specified by the X.509 standard.</p>
<p>One particularly common use for certificate authorities is to sign
certificates used in HTTPS, the secure browsing protocol for the World
Wide Web. Another common use is in issuing identity cards by national
governments for use in electronically signing documents.</p>

<p>Common Channel Signalling</p>
<p>In telephony, common-channel signaling (CCS), in the US also
common-channel interoffice signaling (CCIS), is the transmission of
signaling information (control information) on a separate channel than
the data, and, more specifically, where that signaling channel controls
multiple data channels.</p>
<p>For example, in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) one channel
of a communications link is typically used for the sole purpose of
carrying signaling for establishment and tear down of telephone calls.
The remaining channels are used entirely for the transmission of voice
data. In most cases, a single 64kbit/s channel is sufficient to handle
the call setup and call clear-down traffic for numerous voice and data
channels.</p>
<p>The logical alternative to CCS is channel-associated signaling (CAS), in
which each bearer channel has a signaling channel dedicated to it.</p>
<p>CCS offers the following advantages over CAS, in the context of the
PSTN:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Faster call set-up time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater trunking efficiency due to the quicker set up and clearing,
thereby reducing traffic on the network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can transfer additional information along with the signaling
traffic, providing features such as caller ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signaling can be performed mid-call</p>
<p>The most common CCS signaling methods in use today are Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Signalling System No. 7 (SS7).</p>
<p>ISDN signaling is used primarily on trunks connecting end-user
private branch exchange (PBX) systems to a central office. SS7 is
primarily used within the PSTN. The two signaling methods are very
similar since they share a common heritage and in some cases, the
same signaling messages are transmitted in both ISDN and SS7.</p>

data between mobile phones and cell sites. It is developed by 3GPP2 as a
backwards-compatible successor to second-generation cdmaOne (IS-95) set
of standards and used especially in North America and South Korea.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cdma"><a class="header" href="#cdma">CDMA</a></h1>
<p>Code-division multiple access</p>
<p>Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method used by
various radio communication technologies.</p>
<p>CDMA is an example of multiple access, where several transmitters can
send information simultaneously over a single communication channel.
This allows several users to share a band of frequencies . To permit
this without undue interference between the users, CDMA employs spread
spectrum technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter
is assigned a code).</p>
<p>CDMA is used as the access method in many mobile phone standards. IS-95,
also called &quot;cdmaOne&quot;, and its 3G evolution CDMA2000, are often simply
referred to as &quot;CDMA&quot;, but UMTS, the 3G standard used by GSM carriers,
also uses &quot;wideband CDMA&quot;, or W-CDMA, as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA,
as its radio technologies.</p>

<p>Comfort Noise Generation</p>
<p>Comfort noise (or comfort tone) is synthetic background noise used in
radio and wireless communications to fill the artificial silence in a
transmission resulting from voice activity detection or from the audio
clarity of modern digital lines.</p>
<p>Some modern telephone systems (such as wireless and VoIP) use voice
activity detection (VAD), a form of squelching where low volume levels
are ignored by the transmitting device. In digital audio transmissions,
this saves bandwidth of the communications channel by transmitting
nothing when the source volume is under a certain threshold, leaving
only louder sounds (such as the speaker's voice) to be sent. However,
improvements in background noise reduction technologies can occasionally
result in the complete removal of all noise. Although maximizing call
quality is of primary importance, exhaustive removal of noise may not
properly simulate the typical behavior of terminals on the PSTN system.</p>
<p>The result of receiving total silence, especially for a prolonged
period, has a number of unwanted effects on the listener, including the
following:</p>
<p>the listener may believe that the transmission has been lost, and
therefore hang up prematurely.<br />
the speech may sound &quot;choppy&quot; (see noise gate) and difficult to
understand.<br />
the sudden change in sound level can be jarring to the listener.<br />
To counteract these effects, comfort noise is added, usually on the
receiving end in wireless or VoIP systems, to fill in the silent
portions of transmissions with artificial noise. The noise generated is
at a low but audible volume level, and can vary based on the average
volume level of received signals to minimize jarring transitions.</p>
<p>In many VoIP products, users may control how VAD and comfort noise are
configured, or disable the feature entirely.</p>
<p>As part of the RTP audio video profile, RFC 3389 defines a standard for
distributing comfort noise information in VoIP systems.</p>
<p>A similar concept is that of sidetone, the effect of sound that is
picked up by a telephone's mouthpiece and introduced (at low level) into
the earpiece of the same handset, acting as feedback.</p>

<p>Commercial off-the-shelf</p>
<p>Commercial off-the-shelf or commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS)
is a term used to describe the purchase of packaged solutions which are

than the commissioning of custom-made, or bespoke, solutions. A related
term, Mil-COTS, refers to COTS products for use by the U.S. military.</p>
<p>In the context of the U.S. government, the Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) has defined &quot;COTS&quot; as a formal term for commercial
items, including services, available in the commercial marketplace that
can be bought and used under government contract. For example, Microsoft
is a COTS software provider. Goods and construction materials may
qualify as COTS but bulk cargo does not. Services associated with the
commercial items may also qualify as COTS, including installation
services, training services, and cloud services.</p>
<p>COTS purchases are alternatives to custom software or one-off
developments -- government-funded developments or otherwise.</p>
<p>Although COTS products can be used out of the box, in practice the COTS
product must be configured to achieve the needs of the business and
integrated to existing organizational systems. Extending the
functionality of COTS products via custom development is also an option,
however this decision should be carefully considered due to the long
term support and maintenance implications. Such customized functionality
is not supported by the COTS vendor, so brings its own sets of issues

<p>Carrier Pre-Select</p>
<p>Carrier preselect is a term relating to the telecommunications industry.
It is a method of routing calls for least-cost routing (LCR) without the
need for programming of PBX telephone system.</p>
<p>This is the process whereby a telephone subscriber whose telephone line
is maintained by one company, usually a former monopoly provider
(e.g. BT), can choose to have some of their calls automatically routed
across a different telephone company's network (e.g. Talk Talk) without
needing to enter a special code or special equipment.</p>

<p>Class Responsibility Collaborator Cards</p>
<p>CRC Cards are an object oriented design technique teams can use to
discuss what a class should know and do and what other classes it
interacts with.</p>
<p>CRC cards are usually created from index cards. Members of a
brainstorming session will write up one CRC card for each relevant
class/object of their design. The card is partitioned into three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On top of the card, the class name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the left, the responsibilities of the class<br />
On the right, collaborators (other classes) with which this class
interacts to fulfill its responsibilities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="crc"><a class="header" href="#crc">CRC</a></h1>
<p>cyclic redundancy check</p>
<p>A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used
in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to
raw data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value
attached, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their
contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event
the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against
data corruption. CRCs can be used for error correction (see bitfilters).</p>
<p>CRCs are so called because the check (data verification) value is a
redundancy (it expands the message without adding information) and the
algorithm is based on cyclic codes. CRCs are popular because they are
simple to implement in binary hardware, easy to analyze mathematically,
and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by noise in
transmission channels. Because the check value has a fixed length, the
function that generates it is occasionally used as a hash function.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cscf"><a class="header" href="#cscf">CSCF</a></h1>
<p>Call Session Control Function</p>
<p>Several roles of SIP servers or proxies, collectively called Call
Session Control Function (CSCF), are used to process SIP signaling
packets in the IMS.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is a SIP proxy that is the first point of
contact for the IMS terminal. It can be located either in the
visited network (in full IMS networks) or in the home network (when
the visited network is not IMS compliant yet). Some networks may use
a Session Border Controller (SBC) for this function. The P-CSCF is
at its core a specialized SBC for the User--network interface which
not only protects the network, but also the IMS terminal. The use of
an additional SBC between the IMS terminal and the P-CSCF is
unnecessary and infeasible due to the signaling being encrypted on
this leg. The terminal discovers its P-CSCF with either DHCP, or it
may be configured (e.g. during initial provisioning or via a 3GPP
IMS Management Object (MO)) or in the ISIM or assigned in the PDP
Context (in General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Interrogating-CSCF (I-CSCF) is another SIP function located at
the edge of an administrative domain. Its IP address is published in
the Domain Name System (DNS) of the domain (using NAPTR and SRV type
of DNS records), so that remote servers can find it, and use it as a
forwarding point (e.g., registering) for SIP packets to this domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Serving-CSCF (S-CSCF) is the central node of the signaling plane.
It is a SIP server, but performs session control too. It is always
located in the home network. It uses Diameter Cx and Dx interfaces
to the HSS to download user profiles and upload user-to-S-CSCF
associations (the user profile is only cached locally for processing
reasons and is not changed). All necessary subscriber profile
information is loaded from the HSS.</p>

<p>Customer Site Interconnect</p>
<p>In telecommunications, interconnection is the physical linking of a
carrier's network with equipment or facilities not belonging to that
network. The term may refer to a connection between a carrier's
facilities and the equipment belonging to its customer, or to a
connection between two (or more) carriers.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="csma"><a class="header" href="#csma">CSMA</a></h1>
<p>Carrier-sense multiple access</p>
<p>Carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) is a media access control (MAC)
protocol in which a node verifies the absence of other traffic before
transmitting on a shared transmission medium, such as an electrical bus
or a band of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>A transmitter attempts to determine whether another transmission is in
progress before initiating a transmission using a carrier-sense
mechanism. That is, it tries to detect the presence of a carrier signal
from another node before attempting to transmit. If a carrier is sensed,
the node waits for the transmission in progress to end before initiating
its own transmission. Using CSMA, multiple nodes may, in turn, send and
receive on the same medium. Transmissions by one node are generally
received by all other nodes connected to the medium.</p>
<p>Variations on basic CSMA include addition of collision-avoidance,
collision-detection and collision-resolution techniques.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="css"><a class="header" href="#css">CSS</a></h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and
reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
<p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
the same markup page in different styles for different rendering
methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has
rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
device.</p>
<p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>
<p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use
with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
validation service for CSS documents.</p>
<p>In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS,
including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cue"><a class="header" href="#cue">CUE</a></h1>
<p>Configure Unify Execute</p>
<p>CUE is an open-source data validation language and inference engine with its roots in logic programming. Although the language is not a general-purpose programming language, it has many applications, such as data validation, data templating, configuration, querying, code generation and even scripting. The inference engine can be used to validate data in code or to include it as part of a code generation pipeline.</p>
<p>A key thing that sets CUE apart from its peer languages is that it merges types and values into a single concept. Whereas in most languages types and values are strictly distinct, CUE orders them in a single hierarchy (a lattice, to be precise). This is a very powerful concept that allows CUE to do many fancy things. It also simplifies matters. For instance, there is no need for generics and enums, sum types and null coalescing are all the same thing.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cvsd"><a class="header" href="#cvsd">CVSD</a></h1>
<p>Continuously variable slope delta modulation</p>
<p>Continuously variable slope delta modulation (CVSD or CVSDM) is a voice
coding method. It is a delta modulation with variable step size (i.e.,
special case of adaptive delta modulation), first proposed by Greefkes
and Riemens in 1970.</p>
<p>CVSD encodes at 1 bit per sample, so that audio sampled at 16 kHz is
encoded at 16 kbit/s.</p>
<p>The encoder maintains a reference sample and a step size. Each input
sample is compared to the reference sample. If the input sample is
larger, the encoder emits a 1 bit and adds the step size to the
reference sample. If the input sample is smaller, the encoder emits a 0
bit and subtracts the step size from the reference sample. The encoder
also keeps the previous N bits of output (N = 3 or N = 4 are very
common) to determine adjustments to the step size; if the previous N
bits are all 1s or 0s, the step size is increased. Otherwise, the step
size is decreased (usually in an exponential manner, with
{<code>\displaystyle</code>{=tex}<code>\tau</code>{=tex}} <code>\tau</code>{=tex}being in the range of
5 ms). The step size is adjusted for every input sample processed.</p>
<p>To allow for bit errors to fade out and to allow (re)synchronization to
an ongoing bitstream, the output register (which keeps the reference
sample) is normally realized as a leaky integrator with a time constant
( {<code>\displaystyle</code>{=tex}<code>\tau</code>{=tex}} <code>\tau</code>{=tex}) of about 1 ms.</p>
<p>The decoder reverses this process, starting with the reference sample,
and adding or subtracting the step size according to the bit stream. The
sequence of adjusted reference samples are the reconstructed waveform,
and the step size is adjusted according to the same all-1s-or-0s logic
as in the encoder.</p>
<p>Adaptation of step size allows one to avoid slope overload (step of
quantization increases when the signal rapidly changes) and decreases
granular noise when the signal is constant (decrease of step of
quantisation).</p>
<p>CVSD is sometimes called a compromise between simplicity, low bitrate,
and quality. Common bitrates are 9.6--128 kbit/s.</p>
<p>Like other delta-modulation techniques, the output of the decoder does
not exactly match the original input to the encoder.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="camel-case"><a class="header" href="#camel-case">Camel Case</a></h1>
<p>Camel case (stylized as camelCase or CamelCase; also known as camel caps
or more formally as medial capitals) is the practice of writing compound
words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of
the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or
punctuation. Common examples include &quot;iPhone&quot;, &quot;eBay&quot;, &quot;FedEx&quot;,
&quot;DreamWorks&quot;, and &quot;HarperCollins&quot;. It is also sometimes used in online
usernames such as &quot;JohnSmith&quot;, and to make multi-word domain names more
legible, for example in advertisements.</p>
<p>Programming and coding<br />
The use of medial caps for compound identifiers is recommended by the
coding style guidelines of many organizations or software
projects. For some languages (such as Mesa, Pascal, Modula, Java and
Microsoft's .NET) this practice is recommended by the language
developers or by authoritative manuals and has therefore become part of
the language's &quot;culture&quot;.</p>
<p>Style guidelines often distinguish between upper and lower camel case,
typically specifying which variety should be used for specific kinds of
entities: variables, record fields, methods, procedures, types, etc.
These rules are sometimes supported by static analysis tools that check
source code for adherence.</p>
<p>The original Hungarian notation for programming, for example, specifies
that a lowercase abbreviation for the &quot;usage type&quot; (not data type)
should prefix all variable names, with the remainder of the name in
upper camel case; as such it is a form of lower camel case.</p>
<p>Programming identifiers often need to contain acronyms and initialisms
that are already in uppercase, such as &quot;old HTML file&quot;. By analogy with
the title case rules, the natural camel case rendering would have the
abbreviation all in uppercase, namely &quot;oldHTMLFile&quot;. However, this
approach is problematic when two acronyms occur together (e.g., &quot;parse
DBM XML&quot; would become &quot;parseDBMXML&quot;) or when the standard mandates lower
camel case but the name begins with an abbreviation (e.g. &quot;SQL server&quot;
would become &quot;sQLServer&quot;). For this reason, some programmers prefer to
treat abbreviations as if they were lowercase words and write
&quot;oldHtmlFile&quot;, &quot;parseDbmXml&quot; or &quot;sqlServer&quot;. However, this can make it
harder to recognise that a given word is intended as an acronym.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="capability-maturity-model"><a class="header" href="#capability-maturity-model">Capability Maturity Model</a></h1>
<p>The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a development model created after
a study of data collected from organizations that contracted with the
U.S. Department of Defense, who funded the research. The term &quot;maturity&quot;
relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from
ad hoc practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics,
to active optimization of the processes.</p>
<p>The model's aim is to improve existing software development processes,
but it can also be applied to other processes.</p>
<p>Structure<br />
The model involves five aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maturity Levels: a 5-level process maturity continuum - where the
uppermost (5th) level is a notional ideal state where processes
would be systematically managed by a combination of process
optimization and continuous process improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key Process Areas: a Key Process Area identifies a cluster of
related activities that, when performed together, achieve a set of
goals considered important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goals: the goals of a key process area summarize the states that
must exist for that key process area to have been implemented in an
effective and lasting way. The extent to which the goals have been
accomplished is an indicator of how much capability the organization
has established at that maturity level. The goals signify the scope,
boundaries, and intent of each key process area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common Features: common features include practices that implement
and institutionalize a key process area. There are five types of
common features: commitment to perform, ability to perform,
activities performed, measurement and analysis, and verifying
implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key Practices: The key practices describe the elements of
infrastructure and practice that contribute most effectively to the
implementation and institutionalization of the area.</p>
<p>Levels<br />
There are five levels defined along the continuum of the model and,
according to the SEI: &quot;Predictability, effectiveness, and control of
an organization's software processes are believed to improve as the
organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the
empirical evidence to date supports this belief&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point
for use of a new or undocumented repeat process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeatable - the process is at least documented sufficiently such
that repeating the same steps may be attempted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defined - the process is defined/confirmed as a standard business
process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capable - the process is quantitatively managed in accordance with
agreed-upon metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient - process management includes deliberate process
optimization/improvement.</p>
<p>Within each of these maturity levels are Key Process Areas which
characterise that level, and for each such area there are five
factors: goals, commitment, ability, measurement, and verification.
These are not necessarily unique to CMM, representing --- as they do
--- the stages that organizations must go through on the way to
becoming mature.</p>
<p>The model provides a theoretical continuum along which process
maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the next.
Skipping levels is not allowed/feasible.</p>

<p>COBOL is a compiled English-like computer programming language
designed for business use. It is imperative, procedural and, since 2002,
object-oriented. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and
administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still
widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such
as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. But due to its
declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL
programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in
modern languages or replaced with software packages. Most programming in
COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications.</p>
<p>COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on previous
programming language design work by Grace Hopper, commonly referred to
as &quot;the (grand)mother of COBOL&quot;. It was created as part of a US
Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming
language for data processing. Intended as a stopgap, the Department of
Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting
in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has since
been revised four times. Expansions include support for structured and
object-oriented programming. The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014.</p>
<p>COBOL statements have an English-like syntax, which were designed to be
self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses
over 300 reserved words. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like y
= x;, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, MOVE x TO y).
COBOL code is split into four divisions (identification, environment,
data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs
and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies
43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.</p>

digital data stream or signal. Codec is a portmanteau of coder-decoder.</p>
<p>A codec encodes a data stream or a signal for transmission and storage,
possibly in encrypted form, and the decoder function reverses the
encoding for playback or editing. Codecs are used in videoconferencing,
streaming media, and video editing applications.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compiled-language"><a class="header" href="#compiled-language">Compiled Language</a></h1>
<p>A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are
typically compilers (translators that generate machine code from source
code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code,
where no pre-runtime translation takes place).</p>
<p>The term is somewhat vague. In principle, any language can be
implemented with a compiler or with an interpreter. A combination of
both solutions is also common: a compiler can translate the source code
into some intermediate form (often called p-code or bytecode), which is
then passed to an interpreter which executes it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compiler-back-end"><a class="header" href="#compiler-back-end">Compiler Back end</a></h1>
<p>The back end takes the optimized IR from the middle end. It may perform
more analysis, transformations and optimizations that are specific for
the target CPU architecture. The back end generates the target-dependent
assembly code, performing register allocation in the process. The back
end performs instruction scheduling, which re-orders instructions to
keep parallel execution units busy by filling delay slots. Although most
algorithms for optimization are NP-hard, heuristic techniques are
well-developed and currently implemented in production-quality
compilers. Typically the output of a back end is machine code
specialized for a particular processor and operating system.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compiler-front-end"><a class="header" href="#compiler-front-end">Compiler Front end</a></h1>
<p>The front end verifies syntax and semantics according to a specific
source language. For statically typed languages it performs type
checking by collecting type information. If the input program is
syntactically incorrect or has a type error, it generates errors and
warnings, highlighting[dubious -- discuss] them on the source code.
Aspects of the front end include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and
semantic analysis. The front end transforms the input program into an
intermediate representation (IR) for further processing by the middle
end. This IR is usually a lower-level representation of the program with
respect to the source code</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compiler-middle-end"><a class="header" href="#compiler-middle-end">Compiler Middle end</a></h1>
<p>The middle end performs optimizations on the IR that are independent of
the CPU architecture being targeted. This source code/machine code
independence is intended to enable generic optimizations to be shared
between versions of the compiler supporting different languages and
target processors. Examples of middle end optimizations are removal of
useless (dead code elimination) or unreachable code (reachability
analysis), discovery and propagation of constant values (constant
propagation), relocation of computation to a less frequently executed
place (e.g., out of a loop), or specialization of computation based on
the context. Eventually producing the &quot;optimized&quot; IR that is used by the
back end.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compiler-preprocessor"><a class="header" href="#compiler-preprocessor">Compiler preprocessor</a></h1>
<p>In computer science, a preprocessor is a program that processes its
input data to produce output that is used as input to another program.
The output is said to be a preprocessed form of the input data, which is
often used by some subsequent programs like compilers. The amount and
kind of processing done depends on the nature of the preprocessor; some
preprocessors are only capable of performing relatively simple textual
substitutions and macro expansions, while others have the power of
full-fledged programming languages.</p>
<p>A common example from computer programming is the processing performed
on source code before the next step of compilation. In some computer
languages (e.g., C and PL/I) there is a phase of translation known as
preprocessing. It can also include macro processing, file inclusion and
language extensions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="complier"><a class="header" href="#complier">Complier</a></h1>
<p>A compiler is computer software that transforms computer code written in
one programming language (the source language) into another programming
language (the target language). Compilers are a type of translator that
support digital devices, primarily computers. The name compiler is
primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level
programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language,
object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.</p>
<p>However, there are many different types of compilers. If the compiled
program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different
from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a
cross-compiler. A bootstrap compiler is written in the language that it
intends to compile. A program that translates from a low-level language
to a higher level one is a decompiler. A program that translates between
high-level languages is usually called a source-to-source compiler or
transpiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the
form of expressions without a change of language. The term
compiler-compiler refers to tools used to create parsers that perform
syntax analysis.</p>
<p>A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations:
preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis
(syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an
intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation.
Compilers implement these operations in phases that promote efficient
design and correct transformations of source input to target output.
Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very
difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler
implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.</p>

routing protocols, run in the architectural control element. In most
cases, the routing table contains a list of destination addresses and
the outgoing interface(s) associated with them. Control plane logic also
can define certain packets to be discarded, as well as preferential
treatment of certain packets for which a high quality of service is
defined by such mechanisms as differentiated services.</p>
<p>Depending on the specific router implementation, there may be a separate
forwarding information base that is populated (i.e., loaded) by the
control plane, but used by the forwarding plane to look up packets, at
very high speed, and decide how to handle them.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="copyleft"><a class="header" href="#copyleft">Copyleft</a></h1>
<p>Copyleft (a play on the word copyright) is the practice of offering
people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of a
work with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in
derivative works down the line. Copyleft software licenses are
considered protective or reciprocal, as contrasted with permissive free
software licenses.</p>
<p>Copyleft is a form of licensing, and can be used to maintain copyright
conditions for works ranging from computer software, to documents, to
art, to scientific discoveries and instruments in medicine. In general,
copyright law is used by an author to prohibit recipients from
reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of their work. In
contrast, under copyleft, an author must give every person who receives
a copy of the work permission to reproduce, adapt, or distribute it,
with the accompanying requirement that any resulting copies or
adaptations are also bound by the same licensing agreement.</p>
<p>Copyleft licenses for software require that information necessary for
reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients
of the binaries. The source code files will usually contain a copy of
the license terms and acknowledge the authors.</p>
<p>Copyleft type licenses are a novel use of existing copyright law to
ensure a work remains freely available. The GNU General Public License
(GPL), originally written by Richard Stallman, was the first software
copyleft license to see extensive use, and continues to dominate in that
area. Creative Commons, a non-profit organization founded by Lawrence
Lessig, provides a similar license provision condition called
share-alike.</p>

the code were Michael Ubell, Eric Allman, Mike O'Brien and Jim Kulp.</p>
<p>The C shell is a command processor typically run in a text window,
allowing the user to type commands. The C shell can also read commands
from a file, called a script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename
wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and
control structures for condition-testing and iteration. What
differentiated the C shell from others, especially in the 1980s, were
its interactive features and overall style. Its new features made it
easier and faster to use. The overall style of the language looked more
like C and was seen as more readable.</p>

<p>Digital Access Signalling System 1 (DASS1) is a proprietary protocol
defined by British Telecom to provide ISDN services in the United
Kingdom. It is now obsolete, having been replaced by DASS2. This too
will become obsolete over the coming years as Q.931, a European
standard, becomes widely adopted in the EU.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dass2"><a class="header" href="#dass2">DASS2</a></h1>
<p>Digital Access Signalling System 2 (DASS2) is an obsolescent protocol
defined by British Telecom for digital links to PSTN based on ISDN.
Although still available on request, it has been superseded by ETS 300
102 (&quot;EuroISDN&quot;).</p>
<p>DASS2 is an improved version over DASS1, based on experiences with
DPNSS.</p>
<p>In the UK, the ISDN concept was first introduced to customers by BT with
their DASS2 connections. DASS2 (Digital Access Signalling System) is a
BT-designed signalling standard, and was introduced before the Q.931
standard was finalised by the international community. British Telecom
used the term ISDN when describing their DASS2 lines.</p>
<p>DASS2 lines are provided to customers on a 2Mbit/s link and can handle
30 simultaneous calls (64kbit/s each). DASS2 is still offered by BT and
other UK carriers. Q.931 is the name of the CCITT document that
describes the agreed signalling format for International ISDN. CCITT had
previously been known as International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee. The organisation set out the internationally
agreed standards for telecommunications, and subsequently evolved into
the ITU. In the United Kingdom, the Q.931-based protocol is ETS 300 102
(also known as EuroISDN). This is a very close implementation of the
original CCITT specification. It is a 2Mbit/s service as with DASS2, but
the feature capability is far greater and has negated the problems
associated with DASS2, including echo problems and circuit spikes. In
the UK, both DASS 2 and EuroISDN (ETS 300 102) lines are available to
customers with EuroISDN as the preferred signalling type. Customers
normally choose the desired signalling system, as this will be dictated
by their CPE (Customer Premises Equipment), usually a PABX.</p>
<p>Most modern PABXs can handle many different types of signalling system,
however the trend seems to be away from the DASS2 (which is no longer
being developed by BT and has been known to deny problems with their
DASS2 circuits), and towards the internationally recognised Q.931
standard, which is utilised by many country's telephony service
providers.</p>
<p>The CCITT specify the standards for the layers 1, 2 and 3 signalling
messages. The layer 3 messages are the messages which actually control
the call setup, teardown, and routing.</p>
<p>The layer 3 messages or call control messages are the minimum messages
that must be understood by the interfacing equipment. Individual service
providers may publish their own documentation which details further
messages that will be transported in addition to Q.931 messages. There
are a number of additional European documents that cover supplementary
services. These cover features that may be instigated by exchanges via
the ISDN and require a higher degree of layer 3 implementation.</p>

<p>Distributed Denial of Service</p>
<p>In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack
in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource
unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely
disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of
service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or
resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and
prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.[1]</p>
<p>In a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), the incoming
traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This
effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a
single source.</p>
<p>A DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the
entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter,
disrupting trade.</p>

<p>Distinguished Encoding Rules</p>
<p>ER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) is a restricted variant of
BER for producing unequivocal transfer syntax for data structures
described by ASN.1. Like CER, DER encodings are valid BER encodings. DER
is the same thing as BER with all but one sender's options removed.</p>
<p>DER is a subset of BER providing for exactly one way to encode an ASN.1
value. DER is intended for situations when a unique encoding is needed,
such as in cryptography, and ensures that a data structure that needs to
be digitally signed produces a unique serialized representation. DER can
be considered a canonical form of BER. For example, in BER
a Boolean value of true can be encoded as any of 255 non-zero byte
values, while in DER there is one way to encode a Boolean value of true.</p>
<p>The most significant DER encoding constraints are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Length encoding must use the definite form</p>
<ol>
<li>Additionally, the shortest possible length encoding must be used</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="des"><a class="header" href="#des">DES</a></h1>
<p>Data Encryption Standard</p>
<p>The Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the
encryption of electronic data. Although insecure, it was highly
influential in the advancement of modern cryptography.</p>
<p>Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by
Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of
Standards (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate
for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government
data. In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency
(NSA), the NBS eventually selected a slightly modified version
(strengthened against differential cryptanalysis, but weakened against
brute-force attacks), which was published as an official Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.</p>
<p>The publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard simultaneously
resulted in its quick international adoption and widespread academic
scrutiny. Controversies arose out of classified design elements, a
relatively short key length of the symmetric-key block cipher design,
and the involvement of the NSA, nourishing suspicions about a backdoor.
Today it is known that the S-boxes that had raised those suspicions were
in fact designed by the NSA to actually remove a backdoor they secretly
knew (differential cryptanalysis). However, the NSA also ensured that
the key size was drastically reduced such that they could break it by
brute force attack. The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received
over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their
cryptanalysis.</p>
<p>DES is insecure. This is mainly due to the 56-bit key size being too
small. In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier
Foundation collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15
minutes (see chronology). There are also some analytical results which
demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are
infeasible to mount in practice. The algorithm is believed to be
practically secure in the form of Triple DES, although there are
theoretical attacks. This cipher has been superseded by the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES). Furthermore, DES has been withdrawn as a
standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<br />

<p>In computer security, a DMZ or demilitarized zone (sometimes referred to
as a perimeter network) is a physical or logical subnetwork that
contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to an
untrusted network, usually a larger network such as the Internet. The
purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an
organization's local area network (LAN): an external network node can
access only what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the
organization's network is firewalled. The DMZ functions as a small,
isolated network positioned between the Internet and the private network
and, if its design is effective, allows the organization extra time to
detect and address breaches before they would further penetrate into the
internal networks.<br />

<p>DNS spoofing, also referred to as DNS cache poisoning, is a form of
computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is

<p>Domain Name System</p>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming
system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
Internet or a private network. It associates various information with
domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most
prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the
numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer
services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing
a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an
essential component of the functionality on the Internet, that has been
in use since 1985.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dn"><a class="header" href="#dn">DN</a></h1>
<p>Directory Number</p>
<p>A telephone number is a sequence of digits assigned to a fixed-line
telephone subscriber station connected to a telephone line or to a
wireless electronic telephony device, such as a radio telephone or a
mobile telephone, or to other devices for data transmission via the
public switched telephone network (PSTN) or other private networks.</p>
<p>A telephone number serves as an address for switching telephone calls
using a system of destination code routing. Telephone numbers are
entered or dialed by a calling party on the originating telephone set,
which transmits the sequence of digits in the process of signaling to a
telephone exchange. The exchange completes the call either to another
locally connected subscriber or via the PSTN to the called party.
Telephone numbers are assigned within the framework of a national or
regional telephone numbering plan to subscribers by telephone service
operators, which may be commercial entities, state-controlled
administrations, or other telecommunication industry associations.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dpi"><a class="header" href="#dpi">DPI</a></h1>
<p>Deep Packet Inspection</p>
<p>Deep packet inspection (DPI) is a type of data processing that inspects
in detail the data being sent over a computer network, and usually takes
action by blocking, re-routing, or logging it accordingly. Deep packet
inspection is often used to ensure that data is in the correct format,
to check for malicious code, eavesdropping and internet censorship[1]
among other purposes. There are multiple headers for IP packets; network
equipment only needs to use the first of these (the IP header) for
normal operation, but use of the second header (such as TCP or UDP) is
normally considered to be shallow packet inspection (usually called
stateful packet inspection) despite this definition.[2]</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to acquire packets for deep packet inspection.
Using port mirroring (sometimes called Span Port) is a very common way,
as well as an optical splitter.</p>
<p>Deep Packet Inspection (and filtering) enables advanced network
management, user service, and security functions as well as internet
data mining, eavesdropping, and internet censorship. Although DPI has
been used for Internet management for many years, some advocates of net
neutrality fear that the technique may be used anticompetitively or to
reduce the openness of the Internet.[3]</p>
<p>DPI is used in a wide range of applications, at the so-called
&quot;enterprise&quot; level (corporations and larger institutions), in
telecommunications service providers, and in governments.</p>

<p>Differentiated services or DiffServ is a computer networking
architecture that specifies a simple and scalable mechanism for

to provide low-latency to critical network traffic such as voice or
streaming media while providing simple best-effort service to
non-critical services such as web traffic or file transfers.</p>
<p>DiffServ uses a 6-bit differentiated services code point (DSCP) in the
8-bit differentiated services field (DS field) in the IP header for
packet classification purposes. The DS field replaces the outdated IPv4
TOS field.</p>

<p>Dual Tone Multi Frequency</p>
<p>Dual-tone multi-frequency signalling (DTMF) is an in-band
telecommunication signalling system using the voice-frequency band over
telephone lines between telephone equipment and other communications
devices and switching centres. DTMF was first developed in the Bell
System in the United States, and became known under the trademark
Touch-Tone for use in push-button telephones supplied to telephone
customers, starting in 1963.[1] DTMF is standardized as ITU-T
Recommendation Q.23.[2] It is also known in the UK as MF4.</p>
<p>The Touch-Tone system using a telephone keypad gradually replaced the
use of rotary dial and has become the industry standard for landline and
mobile service. Other multi-frequency systems are used for internal
signalling within the telephone network.<br />

<p>Digital Terrestrial TV</p>
<p>Digital terrestrial television (DTTV or DTT) is a technology for
broadcast television in which land-based (terrestrial) television
stations broadcast television content by radio waves to televisions in
consumers' residences in a digital format. DTTV is a major technological
advance over the previous analog television, and has largely replaced
analog which had been in common use since the middle of the last
century. Test broadcasts began in 1998 with the changeover to DTTV (aka
Analog Switchoff (ASO) or Digital Switchover (DSO)) beginning in 2006
and is now complete in many countries. The advantages of digital
terrestrial television are similar to those obtained by digitising
platforms such as cable TV, satellite, and telecommunications: more
efficient use of limited radio spectrum bandwidth, provision of more
television channels than analog, better quality images, and potentially
lower operating costs for broadcasters (after the initial upgrade
costs).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dtv"><a class="header" href="#dtv">DTV</a></h1>
<p>Digital TV</p>
<p>Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of television signals,
including the sound channel, using digital encoding, in contrast to the
earlier television technology, analog television, in which the video and
audio are carried by analog signals. It is an innovative advance that
represents the first significant evolution in television technology
since color television in the 1950s. Digital TV makes more economical
use of scarce radio spectrum space; it can transmit multiple channels in
the same bandwidth occupied by a single channel of analog television,
and provides many new features that analog television cannot. A
switchover from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2006 in some
countries, and many industrial countries have now completed the
changeover, while other countries are in various stages of adaptation.
Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in
different parts of the world</p>

<p>Dynamically Verified Static Routing</p>
<p>Dynamically Verified Static Routing (DVSR) is a proprietary routing
protocol of the former Redback (now Ericsson) available on SmartEdge and
Smart Services Router products.</p>
<p>DVSR can be defined as a semi-dynamic and semi-static routing protocol.</p>
<p>A DVSR route is based on static routing principle, but the router
regularly checks for the next hop availability before the prefix can be
injected into the local routing table and redistributed towards other
routing tables. The DVSR route configuration allows the setup of success
and failure counters used to declare the route as active or not. It
could be described as a number of DVSR router attempts to ping the next
hop; in case of a given number of successful replies the route is added
to the local routing table or, after a set number of consecutive
failures, the route is withdrawn.</p>
<p>SmartEdge routers support DVSR as a unique edge routing feature in
addition to static routing and regular IGPs, such as IS-IS, OSPF, and
RIP. DVSR is similar to normal static routing. The main difference is
that the DVSR's next hop, or some other relevant host IP address, is
dynamically verified by this protocol before the prefix can be injected
into the local routing table. In many ISP networks, using static routing
without proper next-hop checks results in black holing of network
traffic.</p>

<p>A dark fibre or unlit fibre is an unused optical fibre, available for
use in fibre-optic communication.</p>
<p>The term dark fibre was originally used when referring to the potential
network capacity of telecommunication infrastructure, but now also
refers to the increasingly common practice of leasing fibre optic cables
from a network service provider, or, generally, to the fibre
installations not owned or controlled by traditional carriers. In common
vernacular, dark fibre may sometimes still be called &quot;dark&quot; if it has
been lit by a fibre lessee and not the cable's owner.</p>
<p>A dark fibre network or simply dark network is a privately operated
optical fiber network that is run directly by its operator over dark
fibre leased or purchased from another supplier. This is in contrast to
purchasing bandwidth or leased line capacity on an existing network.
Dark fibre networks may be used for private networking, or as Internet
access or infrastructure.</p>

directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template
for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different
situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the
programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an
application or system.</p>
<p>Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and
interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final
application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply
mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages, some
patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in
support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and
object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for
non-object-oriented languages.</p>
<p>Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer
programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm
and a concrete algorithm.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="domain-name"><a class="header" href="#domain-name">Domain Name</a></h1>
<p>A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of
administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet.
Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name
System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain
names are used in various networking contexts and for
application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a
domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a
personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting
a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via
the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.</p>
<p>Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS
root domain, which is nameless. The first-level set of domain names are
the top-level domains (TLDs), including the generic top-level domains
(gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and
the country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Below these top-level
domains in the DNS hierarchy are the second-level and third-level domain
names that are typically open for reservation by end-users who wish to
connect local area networks to the Internet, create other publicly
accessible Internet resources or run web sites.</p>
<p>The registration of these domain names is usually administered by domain
name registrars who sell their services to the public.</p>
<p>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely
specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts
omitted. Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may

<p>A simple view for dot1q (802.1q) trunking:<br />
For ease of understanding the Dot1q (802.1q) trunking between switches
can be seen as pipes (VLANs) inside a main pipe (Trunk) to connect VLANs
that are being distributed on different switches.<br />
<img src="d/./images/15008019.png?width=448" alt="" /><br />
So if that makes sense then a better representation is that packets are
tagged as they go into the trunk link, like below.<br />
The packets are tagged with the VLAN ID, that the port they are received
on is configured with. When they are received on the other end they are
then sent to the appropriate VLAN ports.<br />
<img src="d/./images/15008025.png?width=448" alt="" /><br />
So how does the switch know which ports to send the packet to, the
switches are assigned with the VLAN number.<br />

<p>IEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q</p>
<p>IEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q, is the networking standard that
supports virtual LANs (VLANs) on an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network. The
standard defines a system of VLAN tagging for Ethernet frames and the
accompanying procedures to be used by bridges and switches in handling
such frames. The standard also contains provisions for a
quality-of-service prioritization scheme commonly known as IEEE 802.1p
and defines the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol.</p>
<p>Portions of the network which are VLAN-aware (i.e., IEEE 802.1Q
conformant) can include VLAN tags. When a frame enters the VLAN-aware
portion of the network, a tag is added to represent the VLAN
membership.[a] Each frame must be distinguishable as being within
exactly one VLAN. A frame in the VLAN-aware portion of the network that
does not contain a VLAN tag is assumed to be flowing on the native VLAN.</p>

3G definition. EDGE was deployed on GSM networks beginning in 2003 --
initially by Cingular (now AT&amp;T) in the United States.</p>
<p>EDGE is standardized also by 3GPP as part of the GSM family. A variant,
so called Compact-EDGE, was developed for use in a portion of Digital

<p>Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE) is an approved
telecommunications networking standard, IEEE 802.1Qay-2009. PBB-TE
adapts Ethernet technology to carrier class transport networks. It is
based on the layered VLAN tags and MAC-in-MAC encapsulation defined in
IEEE 802.1ah (Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB)), but it differs from PBB
in eliminating flooding, dynamically created forwarding tables, and
spanning tree protocols. Compared to PBB and its predecessors, PBB-TE
behaves more predictably and its behavior can be more easily controlled
by the network operator, at the expense of requiring up-front connection
configuration at each bridge along a forwarding path. PBB-TE Operations,
Administration, and Management (OAM) is usually based on IEEE 802.1ag.
It was initially based on Nortel's Provider Backbone Transport (PBT).</p>
<p>PBB-TE's connection-oriented features and behaviors, as well as its OAM
approach, are inspired by SDH/SONET. PBB-TE can also provide path
protection levels similar to the UPSR (Unidirectional Path Switched
Ring) protection in SDH/SONET networks.</p>
<p>Principle of operation<br />
The IEEE 802.1Qay PBB-TE standard extends the functionality of IEEE
802.1ah Provider Backbone Bridges, adding a connection-oriented mode
using point-to-point trunks that deliver resiliency and configurable
performance levels.</p>
<p>A service is identified by an I-SID (Backbone Service Instance
Identifier) and each service is associated with a PBB-TE trunk. Each
PBB-TE trunk is identified by a triplet of B-SA, B-DA and B-VID. The
B-SA and B-DA identify the source and destination bridges, respectively,
that are the endpoints of the trunk. The B-VID is a backbone VLAN
identifier that is used to distinguish different trunks to the same
destination. The management system configures the PBB-TE trunks on all
the edge and core bridges by creating static forwarding database
entries; the management system is responsible for ensuring that there
are no forwarding loops.</p>
<p>The backbone edge bridges map frames to and from an I-SID and perform
the MAC header encapsulation and decapsulation functions. The core
bridges act as transit nodes. The packets are forwarded based on outer
VLAN ID (B-VID) and Destination MAC address (B-DA).</p>
<p>Forwarding is based on the static forwarding database (FDB) entries;
dynamic MAC learning is not used. Any incoming broadcast or multicast
frames are either dropped or encapsulated as unicast within the trunk.
All Destination Lookup Failure packets are dropped rather than flooded.
By eliminating any broadcasting or flooding, and by using only the
loop-free forwarding paths configured by management, there is no longer
any need to use a spanning tree protocol.</p>
<p>Path protection is provided by configuring one work and one protect
B-VID for each backbone service instance. In case of work path failure
(as indicated by loss of 802.1ag continuity check messages, CCMs) the
source bridge swaps the B-VID value to redirect the traffic onto the
preconfigured protection path within 50 ms.</p>
<p>PBB-TE equipment leverages economies of scale inherent in Ethernet,
promising solutions that are 30% to 40% cheaper than T-MPLS networks
with identical features and capabilities, giving PBB-TE a better overall
return on investment.</p>

<p>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol</p>
<p>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an advanced
distance-vector routing protocol that is used on a computer network for
automating routing decisions and configuration. The protocol was
designed by Cisco Systems as a proprietary protocol, available only on
Cisco routers. Functionality of EIGRP was converted to an open standard
in 2013[1] and was published with informational status as RFC 7868 in
2016.</p>
<p>EIGRP is used on a router to share routes with other routers within the
same autonomous system. Unlike other well known routing protocols, such
as RIP, EIGRP only sends incremental updates, reducing the workload on
the router and the amount of data that needs to be transmitted.</p>
<p>EIGRP replaced the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) in 1993. One
of the major reasons for this was the change to classless IPv4 addresses
in the Internet Protocol, which IGRP could not support.</p>

<p>Enterprise Service Bus</p>
<p>An enterprise service bus (ESB) implements a communication system
between mutually interacting software applications in a service-oriented
architecture (SOA). It implements a software architecture as depicted in
the picture. As it implements a distributed computing architecture, it
implements a special variant of the more general client-server model,
wherein, in general, any application using ESB can behave as server or
client in turns. ESB promotes agility and flexibility with regard to
high-level protocol communication between applications. The primary goal
of the high-level protocol communication is enterprise application
integration (EAI) of heterogeneous and complex service or application
landscapes (a view from the network level).<br />
The concept is analogous to the bus concept found in computer hardware
architecture combined with the modular and concurrent design of
high-performance computer operating systems. The motivation for the
development of ESB was to find a standard, structured, and general
purpose concept for describing implementation of loosely coupled
software components (called services) that are expected to be
independently deployed, running, heterogeneous, and disparate within a
network. ESB is also a common implementation pattern for
service-oriented architecture.</p>
<p>An ESB applies the design concept of modern operating systems to
independent services running within networks of disparate and
independent computers. Like concurrent operating systems, an ESB
provides commodity services in addition to adoption, translation and
routing of client requests to appropriate answering services.</p>
<p>The primary duties of an ESB are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Route messages between services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor and control routing of message exchange between services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolve contention between communicating service components</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control deployment and versioning of services</p>

<li>
<p>Marshal use of redundant services</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Extract is the process of reading data from a database. In this

types of sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transform is the process of converting the extracted data from its
previous form into the form it needs to be in so that it can be
placed into another database. Transformation occurs by using rules
or lookup tables or by combining the data with other data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load is the process of writing the data into the target database.<br />
Data from one or more sources is extracted and then copied to the
data warehouse. When dealing with large volumes of data and multiple
source systems, the data is consolidated. ETL is used to migrate

interfaces that identifies a point-to-point or multipoint-to-multipoint
path within the service provider network. An EVC is a conceptual service
pipe within the service provider network. A bridge domain is a local

<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Line</p>
<p>Ethernet private line (EPL) and Ethernet virtual private line (EVPL) are
data services defined by the MEF. EPL provides a point-to-point Ethernet
virtual connection (EVC) between a pair of dedicated user--network
interfaces (UNIs), with a high degree of transparency. EVPL provides a
point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connection between a pair of UNIs.</p>
<p>The services are categorized as an E-Line service type, with an
expectation of low frame delay, frame delay variation and frame loss
ratio. EPL is implemented using a point-to-point EVC with no Service
Multiplexing at each UNI (physical interface), i.e., all service frames
at the UNI are mapped to a single EVC (a.k.a. all-to-one bundling).</p>
<p>Due to a high degree of transparency, EPL is often used to provide
point-to-point Transparent LAN Service (TLS), where the service frame's
header and payload are identical at both the source and destination UNI.
Some implementations tunnel most Ethernet Layer 2 Control Protocols
(L2CPs) except for some link layer L2CPs such as IEEE 802.3x pause
frames.</p>
<p>Unlike EPL, EVPL allows for service multiplexing, i.e., multiple EVCs or
Ethernet services per UNI. The other difference between the EVPL and EPL
is the degree of transparency - while EPL is highly transparent,
filtering only the pause frames, EVPL is required to either peer or drop
most of the Layer 2 Control Protocols.</p>

<p>Echo has a major effect on voice quality in telecommunication networks.
The objectionable effect of echo results from a combination of
reflections from network components such as 2- to 4-wire converters,
together with signal processing and transmission delay. Echo may cause
users difficulty in<br />
talking or listening over a telephone connection. It may also affect the
transmission of voiceband data, fax, and text telephones.<br />
Digital network echo cancellers are designed to eliminate echo for the
user and to allow successful transmission of voiceband data and fax.
Recommendation ITU-T G.168 describes the characteristics of an echo
canceller, including the requirement for in-band tone disabling and
other control<br />
mechanisms. It also describes a number of laboratory tests that should
be performed on an echo canceller to assess its performance under
conditions likely to be experienced in the network</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="echo-cancellation"><a class="header" href="#echo-cancellation">Echo cancellation</a></h1>
<p>Echo suppression and echo cancellation are methods used in telephony to
improve voice quality by preventing echo from being created or removing
it after it is already present. In addition to improving subjective
audio quality, echo suppression increases the capacity achieved through
silence suppression by preventing echo from traveling across a network.
Echo suppressors were developed in the 1950s in response to the first
use of satellites for telecommunications, but they have since been
largely supplanted by better performing echo cancellers.</p>
<p>Echo suppression and cancellation methods are commonly called acoustic
echo suppression (AES) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), and more
rarely line echo cancellation (LEC). In some cases, these terms are more
precise, as there are various types and causes of echo with unique
characteristics, including acoustic echo (sounds from a loudspeaker
being reflected and recorded by a microphone, which can vary
substantially over time) and line echo (electrical impulses caused by,
e.g., coupling between the sending and receiving wires, impedance
mismatches, electrical reflections, etc., which varies much less than
acoustic echo). In practice, however, the same techniques are used to
treat all types of echo, so an acoustic echo canceller can cancel line
echo as well as acoustic echo. AEC in particular is commonly used to
refer to echo cancelers in general, regardless of whether they were
intended for acoustic echo, line echo, or both.</p>
<p>Although echo suppressors and echo cancellers have similar
goals---preventing a speaking individual from hearing an echo of their
own voice---the methods they use are different:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Echo suppressors work by detecting a voice signal going in one
direction on a circuit, and then muting or attenuating the signal in
other direction. Usually the echo suppressor at the far end of the
circuit does this muting when it detects voice coming from the
near-end of the circuit. This muting prevents the speaker from
hearing their own voice returning from the far end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Echo cancellation involves first recognizing the originally
transmitted signal that re-appears, with some delay, in the
transmitted or received signal. Once the echo is recognized, it can
be removed by subtracting it from the transmitted or received

<p>In audio signal processing and acoustics, Echo is a reflection of sound
that arrives at the listener with a delay after the direct sound. The
delay is proportional to the distance of the reflecting surface from the
source and the listener. Typical examples are the echo produced by the
bottom of a well, by a building, or by the walls of an enclosed room and
an empty room. A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source.</p>

<p>Ethernet over Fibre to the Cabinet</p>
<p>Ethernet over Fibre to the Cabinet (EoFTTC) is provided by copper from
your business premises over the short distance to the green cabinets in
the street. Unlike standard broadband where the copper then continues
all the way to the exchange, Ethernet over Fibre to the Cabinet traffic
travels across a shared fibre optic circuit to the exchange. The extra
distance doesn't lead to ongoing degradation of performance, which
allows access to up to 20Mbps symmetrical speed with the additional
boost downstream making a total of 76Mbps downstream bandwidth.<br />

<p>Ethernet Over SONET</p>
<p>Ethernet Over SDH (EoS or EoSDH) or Ethernet over SONET refers to a set
of protocols which allow Ethernet traffic to be carried over synchronous
digital hierarchy networks in an efficient and flexible way. The same
functions are available using SONET.</p>
<p>Ethernet frames which are to be sent on the SDH link are sent through an
&quot;encapsulation&quot; block (typically Generic Framing Procedure or GFP) to
create a synchronous stream of data from the asynchronous Ethernet
packets. The synchronous stream of encapsulated data is then passed
through a mapping block which typically uses virtual concatenation
(VCAT) to route the stream of bits over one or more SDH paths. As this
is byte interleaved, it provides a better level of security compared to
other mechanisms for Ethernet transport.</p>

<p>Ethernet over twisted-pair technologies use twisted-pair cables for the
physical layer of an Ethernet computer network. They are a subset of all
Ethernet physical layers.</p>
<p>Early Ethernet used various grades of coaxial cable, but in 1984,
StarLAN showed the potential of simple unshielded twisted pair. This led
to the development of 10BASE-T and its successors 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T
and 10GBASE-T, supporting speeds of 10 and 100 megabit per second, then
1 and 10 gigabit per second respectively.</p>
<p>Two new variants of 10 megabit per second Ethernet over a single twisted
pair, known as 10BASE-T1S and 10BASE-T1L, were standardized in IEEE Std
802.3cg-2019.[2] 10BASE-T1S has its origins in the automotive industry
and may be useful in other short-distance applications where substantial
electrical noise is present. 10BASE-T1L is a long-distance Ethernet,
supporting connections up to 1 km in length. Both of these standards are
finding applications implementing the Internet of things.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fips-140-2"><a class="header" href="#fips-140-2">FIPS 140-2</a></h1>
<p>The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2,
(FIPS PUB 140-2), is a U.S. government computer security standard used
to approve cryptographic modules. The title is Security
Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. Initial publication was on May
25, 2001 and was last updated December 3, 2002</p>
<p>Purpose<br />
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued the
FIPS 140 Publication Series to coordinate the requirements and
standards for cryptography modules that include both hardware and
software components. Protection of a cryptographic module within a
security system is necessary to maintain the confidentiality and
integrity of the information protected by the module. This standard
specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a
cryptographic module. The standard provides four increasing, qualitative
levels of security intended to cover a wide range of potential
applications and environments. The security requirements cover areas
related to the secure design and implementation of a cryptographic
module. These areas include cryptographic module specification;
cryptographic module ports and interfaces; roles, services, and
authentication; finite state model; physical security; operational
environment; cryptographic key management; electromagnetic
interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC); self-tests; design
assurance; and mitigation of other attacks.</p>
<p>Federal agencies and departments can validate that the module in use is
covered by an existing FIPS 140-1 or FIPS 140-2 certificate that
specifies the exact module name, hardware, software, firmware, and/or
applet version numbers. The cryptographic modules are produced by
the private sector or open source communities for use by the U.S.
government and other regulated industries (such as financial and
health-care institutions) that collect, store, transfer, share and
disseminate sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. A commercial
cryptographic module is also commonly referred to as a hardware security
module (HSM).</p>
<p>Security levels<br />
FIPS 140-2 defines four levels of security, simply named &quot;Level 1&quot; to
&quot;Level 4&quot;. It does not specify in detail what level of security is
required by any particular application.</p>
<p>Level 1<br />
Security Level 1 provides the lowest level of security. Basic security
requirements are specified for a cryptographic module (e.g., at least
one Approved algorithm or Approved security function shall be used). No
specific physical security mechanisms are required in a Security Level 1
cryptographic module beyond the basic requirement for production-grade
components. An example of a Security Level 1 cryptographic module is a
personal computer (PC) encryption board.</p>
<p>Level 2<br />
Security Level 2 improves upon the physical security mechanisms of a
Security Level 1 cryptographic module by requiring features that show
evidence of tampering, including tamper-evident coatings or seals that
must be broken to attain physical access to the plaintext cryptographic
keys and critical security parameters (CSPs) within the module, or
pick-resistant locks on covers or doors to protect against unauthorized
physical access.</p>
<p>Level 3<br />
In addition to the tamper-evident physical security mechanisms required
at Security Level 2, Security Level 3 attempts to prevent the intruder
from gaining access to CSPs held within the cryptographic module.
Physical security mechanisms required at Security Level 3 are intended
to have a high probability of detecting and responding to attempts at
physical access, use or modification of the cryptographic module. The
physical security mechanisms may include the use of strong enclosures
and tamper-detection/response circuitry that zeroes all plaintext CSPs
when the removable covers/doors of the cryptographic module are opened.</p>
<p>Level 4<br />
Security Level 4 provides the highest level of security. At this
security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete
envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent
of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical
access. Penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure from any
direction has a very high probability of being detected, resulting in
the immediate deletion of all plaintext CSPs.</p>
<p>Security Level 4 cryptographic modules are useful for operation in
physically unprotected environments. Security Level 4 also protects a
cryptographic module against a security compromise due to environmental
conditions or fluctuations outside of the module's normal operating
ranges for voltage and temperature. Intentional excursions beyond the
normal operating ranges may be used by an attacker to thwart a
cryptographic module's defenses. A cryptographic module is required to
either include special environmental protection features designed to
detect fluctuations and delete CSPs, or to undergo rigorous
environmental failure testing to provide a reasonable assurance that the
module will not be affected by fluctuations outside of the normal
operating range in a manner that can compromise the security of the
module.</p>

<p>Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are publicly announced
standards developed by the United States federal government for use in
computer systems by non-military government agencies and government
contractors.</p>
<p>FIPS standards are issued to establish requirements for various purposes
such as ensuring computer security and interoperability, and are
intended for cases in which suitable industry standards do not already
exist. Many FIPS specifications are modified versions of standards used
in the technical communities, such as the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>

<p>Fully Qualified Domain Name</p>
<p>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an
absolute domain name, is a domain name that specifies its exact location
in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all
domain levels, including at least a second-level domain and a top-level
domain. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of
ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way.</p>
<p>The DNS root domain is unnamed which is expressed by having an empty
label in the DNS hierarchy, resulting in a fully qualified domain name
ending with the top-level domain. However, in some cases the full stop
(period) character is required at the end of the fully qualified domain
name.</p>
<p>In contrast to a domain name that is fully specified, a domain name that
does not include the full path of labels up to the DNS root is often
called a partially qualified domain name.</p>

active mobile phones in a residential setting depending on version
number and femtocell hardware, and eight to sixteen mobile phones in
enterprise settings. A femtocell allows service providers to extend
service coverage indoors or at the cell edge, especially where access
would otherwise be limited or unavailable. Although much attention is
focused on WCDMA, the concept is applicable to all standards, including

<p>Fortran is a general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language
that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific
computing.</p>
<p>Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering
applications, FORTRAN came to dominate this area of programming early on
and has been in continuous use for over half a century in
computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction,
finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational
physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular
language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that
benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.</p>
<p>Fortran encompasses a lineage of versions, each of which evolved to add
extensions to the language while usually retaining compatibility with
prior versions. Successive versions have added support for structured
programming and processing of character-based data (FORTRAN 77), array
programming, modular programming and generic programming (Fortran 90),
high performance Fortran (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming
(Fortran 2003) and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).</p>
<p>Fortran's design was the basis for many other programming languages.
Among the better known is BASIC, which is a based on FORTRAN II with a
number of syntax cleanups, notably better logical structures, and other
changes to more easily work in an interactive environment.</p>

<p>Frame Relay is a standardized wide area network technology that
specifies the physical and data link layers of digital
telecommunications channels using a packet switching methodology.
Originally designed for transport across Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) infrastructure, it may be used today in the context of
many other network interfaces.</p>
<p>Network providers commonly implement Frame Relay for voice (VoFR) and
data as an encapsulation technique used between local area networks
(LANs) over a wide area network (WAN). Each end-user gets a private line
(or leased line) to a Frame Relay node. The Frame Relay network handles
the transmission over a frequently changing path transparent to all
end-user extensively used WAN protocols. It is less expensive than
leased lines and that is one reason for its popularity. The extreme
simplicity of configuring user equipment in a Frame Relay network offers
another reason for Frame Relay's popularity.</p>

is a two-way communication channel between them, or more strictly
speaking, because there are two communication channels between them.</p>

<p>G.711.1 is an extension to G.711, published as ITU-T Recommendation
G.711.1 in March 2008. Its formal name is Wideband embedded extension
for G.711 pulse code modulation.</p>
<p>G.711.1, allows the addition of narrowband and/or wideband (16000
samples/s) enhancements, each at 25% of the bitrate of the (included)
base G.711 bitstream, leading to data rates of 64, 80 or 96 kbit/s.</p>
<p>G.711.1 is compatible with G.711 at 64 kbit/s, hence an efficient
deployment in existing G.711-based voice over IP (VoIP) infrastructures
is foreseen. The G.711.1 coder can encode signals at 16 kHz with a
bandwidth of 50--7000 Hz at 80 and 96 kbit/s, and for 8-kHz sampling the
output may produce signals with a bandwidth ranging from 50 up to 4000
Hz, operating at 64 and 80 kbit/s.</p>
<p>The G.711.1 encoder creates an embedded bitstream structured in three
layers corresponding to three available bit rates: 64, 80 and 96 kbit/s.
The bitstream does not contain any information on which layers are
contained, an implementation would require outband signalling on which
layers are available. The three G.711.1 layers are: log companded pulse
code modulation (PCM) of the lower band including noise feedback,
embedded PCM extension with adaptive bit allocation for enhancing the
quality of the base layer in the lower band, and weighted vector
quantization coding of the higher band based on modified discrete cosine
transformation (MDCT).</p>
<p>Two extensions for G.711.1 are planned in 2010: superwideband extension
(bandwidth to 14000 Hz) and lossless bitstream compression.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="g711"><a class="header" href="#g711">G.711</a></h1>
<p>G.711 is an ITU-T standard for audio companding. It is primarily used in
telephony. The standard was released for usage in 1972. Its formal name
is Pulse code modulation (PCM) of voice frequencies. It is a required
standard in many technologies, for example in H.320 and H.323
specifications. It can also be used for fax communication over IP
networks (as defined in T.38 specification). G.711, also known as Pulse
Code Modulation (PCM), is a very commonly used waveform codec. G.711 is
a narrowband audio codec that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s.
G.711 passes audio signals in the range of 300--3400 Hz and samples them
at the rate of 8,000 samples per second, with the tolerance on that rate
of 50 parts per million (ppm). Non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization
with 8 bits is used to represent each sample, resulting in a 64 kbit/s
bit rate. There are two slightly different versions: μ-law, which is
used primarily in North America and Japan, and A-law, which is in use in
most other countries outside North America.</p>
<p>Two enhancements to G.711 have been published: G.711.0 utilizes lossless
data compression to reduce the bandwidth usage and G.711.1 increases
audio quality by increasing bandwidth.</p>
<p>Types<br />
G.711 defines two main companding algorithms, the µ-law algorithm and
A-law algorithm. Both are logarithmic, but A-law was specifically
designed to be simpler for a computer to process. The standard also
defines a sequence of repeating code values which defines the power
level of 0 dB.</p>
<p>The µ-law and A-law algorithms encode 14-bit and 13-bit signed linear
PCM samples (respectively) to logarithmic 8-bit samples. Thus, the G.711
encoder will create a 64 kbit/s bitstream for a signal sampled at 8 kHz.</p>
<p>G.711 μ-law tends to give more resolution to higher range signals while
G.711 A-law provides more quantization levels at lower signal levels.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="g719"><a class="header" href="#g719">G.719</a></h1>
<p>G.719 is an ITU-T standard audio coding format providing high quality,
moderate bit rate (32 to 128 kbit/s) wideband (20 Hz - 20 kHz audio
bandwidth, 48 kHz audio sample rate) audio coding at low computational
load. It was produced through a collaboration between Polycom and
Ericsson.</p>
<p>G.719 incorporates elements of Polycom's Siren22 codec (22 kHz) and
Ericsson codec technology, as well as Polycom's Siren7 and Siren14
codecs (G.722.1 and G.722.1 Annex C), which have been used in
videoconferencing systems for many years. As ITU-T Recommendation G.719,
it was approved on June 13, 2008.</p>
<p>G.719 is optimized for both speech and music. It is based on transform
coding with adaptive time-resolution, adaptive bit-allocation and low
complexity lattice vector quantization. The computational complexity is
quite low (18 floating-point MIPS) for an efficient high-quality
compressor. The codec operates on 20 ms frames, and the algorithmic
delay end-to-end is 40 ms. The encoder input and decoder output are
sampled at 48 kHz.</p>
<p>In addition to the nominal bit rates of 32, 48 and 64 kbit/s, the G.719
codec has an inherent feature of flexible rate selection. In fact, it is
possible to accommodate any rate between 32 kbit/s and 64 kbit/s by
steps of 4 kbit/s. Moreover, the codec can also provide higher rates
than 64 kbit/s and up to 128 kbit/s.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="g722"><a class="header" href="#g722">G.722</a></h1>
<p>G.722 is an ITU-T standard 7 kHz Wideband audio codec operating at 48,
56 and 64 kbit/s. It was approved by ITU-T in November 1988. Technology
of the codec is based on sub-band ADPCM (SB-ADPCM).</p>
<p>G722 provides improved speech quality due to a wider speech bandwidth of
50--7000 Hz compared to narrowband speech coders like G.711 which in
general are optimized for POTS wireline quality of 300--3400 Hz. G.722
sample audio data at a rate of 16 kHz (using 14 bits), double that of
traditional telephony interfaces, which results in superior audio
quality and clarity.[2]</p>
<p>Other ITU-T 7 kHz wideband codecs include G.722.1 and G.722.2. These
codecs are not variants of G.722 and they use different patented
compression technologies. G.722.1 is based on Siren codecs and offers
lower bit-rate compressions (24 kbit/s or 32 kbit/s). A more recent
G.722.2, also known as AMR-WB (&quot;Adaptive Multirate Wideband&quot;) is based
on ACELP and offers even lower bit-rate compressions (6.6 kbit/s to
23.85 kbit/s), as well as the ability to quickly adapt to varying
compressions as the network topography mutates. In the latter case,
bandwidth is automatically conserved when network congestion is high.
When congestion returns to a normal level, a lower-compression,
higher-quality bitrate is restored.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="g7231"><a class="header" href="#g7231">G.723.1</a></h1>
<p>G.723.1 is an audio codec for voice that compresses voice audio in 30 ms
frames. An algorithmic look-ahead of 7.5 ms duration means that total
algorithmic delay is 37.5 ms. Its official name is Dual rate speech
coder for multimedia communications transmitting at 5.3 and 6.3 kbit/s.
It is sometimes associated with a Truespeech trademark in coprocessors
produced by DSP Group.[1]</p>
<p>This is a completely different codec from G.723.</p>
<p>There are two bit rates at which G.723.1 can operate:</p>
<p>6.3 kbit/s (using 24 byte frames) using a MPC-MLQ algorithm (MOS 3.9)<br />
5.3 kbit/s (using 20 byte frames) using an ACELP algorithm (MOS 3.62)</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="g726"><a class="header" href="#g726">G.726</a></h1>
<p>G.726 is an ITU-T ADPCM speech codec standard covering the transmission
of voice at rates of 16, 24, 32, and 40 kbit/s. It was introduced to
supersede both G.721, which covered ADPCM at 32 kbit/s, and G.723, which
described ADPCM for 24 and 40 kbit/s. G.726 also introduced a new 16
kbit/s rate. The four bit rates associated with G.726 are often referred
to by the bit size of a sample, which are 2, 3, 4, and 5-bits
respectively.</p>
<p>The most commonly used mode is 32 kbit/s, which doubles the usable
network capacity by using half the rate of G.711. It is primarily used
on international trunks in the phone network and is the standard codec
used in DECT wireless phone systems. The principal application of 24 and
16 kbit/s channels is for overload channels carrying voice in digital
circuit multiplication equipment (DCME). The principal application of 40
kbit/s channels is to carry data modem signals in DCME, especially for
modems operating at greater than 4800 bit/s.</p>

<p>Gateway GPRS support node</p>
<p>The gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) is a main component of the GPRS
network. The GGSN is responsible for the internetworking between the
GPRS network and external packet switched networks, such as the Internet
or an X.25 network.</p>
<p>From an external network's point of view, the GGSN is a router to a
&quot;sub-network&quot;, because the GGSN 'hides' the GPRS infrastructure from the
external network. When the GGSN receives data addressed to a specific
user, it checks if the user is active. If it is, the GGSN forwards the
data to the SGSN serving the mobile user, but if the mobile user is
inactive, the data is discarded. In the other direction,
mobile-originated packets are routed to the right network by the GGSN.</p>
<p>The GGSN is the anchor point that enables the mobility of the user
terminal in the GPRS/UMTS networks. In essence, it carries out the role
in GPRS equivalent to the home agent in Mobile IP. It maintains routing
necessary to tunnel the protocol data units (PDUs) to the SGSN that
services a particular MS (mobile station).</p>
<p>The GGSN converts the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN into the
appropriate packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or X.25) and
sends them out on the corresponding packet data network. In the other
direction, PDP addresses of incoming data packets are converted to the
GSM address of the destination user. The readdressed packets are sent to
the responsible SGSN. For this purpose, the GGSN stores the current SGSN
address of the user and his or her profile in its location register. The
GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router
for the connected user equipment (UE). The GGSN also performs
authentication and charging functions.</p>
<p>Other functions include subscriber screening, IP pool management and
address mapping, QoS and PDP context enforcement.</p>
<p>With LTE scenario the GGSN functionality moves to SAE gateway (with SGSN
functionality working in MME).</p>

<p>The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free
software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study,
share and modify the software. The license was originally written by
Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU
Project, and grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of
the Free Software Definition. The GPL is a copyleft license, which means
that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license
terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of
which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL
was the first copyleft license for general use.</p>
<p>Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular
software licenses in the free and open-source software domain. Prominent
free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel
and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A. Wheeler argues that the
copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based
systems, giving the programmers who contributed to the kernel the
assurance that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free,
rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to
give anything back to the community.</p>
<p>In 2007, the third version of the license (GNU GPLv3) was released to
address some perceived problems with the second version (GNU GPLv2) that

<p>General Packet Radio Service</p>
<p>General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet oriented mobile data
standard on the 2G and 3G cellular communication network's global system
for mobile communications (GSM). GPRS was established by European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in response to the earlier
CDPD and i-mode packet-switched cellular technologies. It is now
maintained by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p>
<p>GPRS is typically sold according to the total volume of data transferred
during the billing cycle, in contrast with circuit switched data, which
is usually billed per minute of connection time, or sometimes by
one-third minute increments. Usage above the GPRS bundled data cap may
be charged per Mb of data, speed limited, or disallowed.</p>
<p>GPRS is a best-effort service, implying variable throughput and latency
that depend on the number of other users sharing the service
concurrently, as opposed to circuit switching, where a certain quality
of service (QoS) is guaranteed during the connection. In 2G systems,
GPRS provides data rates of 56--114 kbit/sec. 2G cellular technology
combined with GPRS is sometimes described as 2.5G, that is, a technology
between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony.
It provides moderate-speed data transfer, by using unused time division
multiple access (TDMA) channels in, for example, the GSM system. GPRS is
integrated into GSM Release 97 and newer releases.<br />

<p>GSM Adaptive Multi-Rate</p>
<p>The Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR, AMR-NB or GSM-AMR) audio codec is an audio
compression format optimized for speech coding. AMR speech codec
consists of a multi-rate narrowband speech codec that encodes narrowband
(200--3400 Hz) signals at variable bit rates ranging from 4.75 to 12.2
kbit/s with toll quality speech starting at 7.4 kbit/s.</p>
<p>AMR was adopted as the standard speech codec by 3GPP in October 1999 and
is now widely used in GSM[4] and UMTS. It uses link adaptation to
select from one of eight different bit rates based on link conditions.</p>
<p>AMR is also a file format for storing spoken audio using the AMR codec.
Many modern mobile telephone handsets can store short audio recordings
in the AMR format, and both free and proprietary programs exist (see
Software support) to convert between this and other formats, although
AMR is a speech format and is unlikely to give ideal results for other
audio. The common filename extension is .amr. There also exists another
storage format for AMR that is suitable for applications with more
advanced demands on the storage format, like random access or
synchronization with video. This format is the 3GPP-specified 3GP
container format based on ISO base media file format.</p>

<p>GSM Full Rate</p>
<p>Full Rate (FR or GSM-FR or GSM 06.10 or sometimes simply GSM) was the
first digital speech coding standard used in the GSM digital mobile
phone system. The bit rate of the codec is 13 kbit/s, or 1.625
bits/audio sample (often padded out to 33 bytes/20 ms or 13.2 kbit/s).
The quality of the coded speech is quite poor by modern standards, but
at the time of development (early 1990s) it was a good compromise
between computational complexity and quality, requiring only on the
order of a million additions and multiplications per second. The codec
is still widely used in networks around the world. Gradually FR will be
replaced by Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR)
standards, which provide much higher speech quality with lower bit rate.</p>

<p>The Gateway Control Protocol (Megaco, H.248) is an implementation of the
media gateway control protocol architecture for providing
telecommunication services across a converged internetwork consisting of
the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN) and modern
packet networks, such as the Internet. H.248 is the designation of the
recommendations developed by the ITU Telecommunication Standardization
Sector (ITU-T) and Megaco is a contraction of media gateway control
protocol used by the earliest specifications by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). The standard published in March 2013 by ITU-T is
entitled H.248.1: Gateway control protocol: Version 3.</p>
<p>Megaco/H.248 follows the guidelines published in RFC 2805 in April 2000,
entitled Media Gateway Control Protocol Architecture and Requirements.
The protocol performs the same functions as the Media Gateway Control
Protocol (MGCP), is however a formal standard while MGCP has only
informational status. Using different syntax and symbolic
representation, the two protocols are not directly interoperable. They
are both complementary to H.323 and the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) protocols.</p>
<p>H.248 was the result of collaboration of the MEGACO working group of the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the International
Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Study Group 16. The IETF
originally published the standard as RFC 3015, which was superseded by
RFC 3525. The term Megaco is the IETF designation. Megaco combines
concepts from MGCP and the Media Device Control Protocol (MDCP). MGCP
originated from a combination of the Simple Gateway Control Protocol
(SGCP) with the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC).</p>
<p>After the ITU took responsibility of the protocol maintenance, the IETF
reclassified its publications as historic in RFC 5125. The ITU has
published three versions of H.248, the most recent in September 2005.
H.248 encompasses not only the base protocol specification in H.248.1,
but many extensions defined throughout the H.248 sub-series.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="h323"><a class="header" href="#h323">H.323</a></h1>
<p>H.323 is a recommendation from the ITU Telecommunication Standardization
Sector (ITU-T) that defines the protocols to provide audio-visual
communication sessions on any packet network. The H.323 standard
addresses call signaling and control, multimedia transport and control,
and bandwidth control for point-to-point and multi-point
conferences.[1]</p>
<p>It is widely implemented[2] by voice and videoconferencing equipment
manufacturers, is used within various Internet real-time applications
such as GnuGK and NetMeeting and is widely deployed worldwide by service
providers and enterprises for both voice and video services over IP
networks.</p>
<p>It is a part of the ITU-T H.32x series of protocols, which also address
multimedia communications over ISDN, the PSTN or SS7, and 3G mobile
networks.</p>
<p>H.323 call signaling is based on the ITU-T Recommendation Q.931 protocol
and is suited for transmitting calls across networks using a mixture of
IP, PSTN, ISDN, and QSIG over ISDN. A call model, similar to the ISDN
call model, eases the introduction of IP telephony into existing
networks of ISDN-based PBX systems, including transitions to IP-based
PBXs.</p>
<p>Within the context of H.323, an IP-based PBX might be a gatekeeper or
other call control element which provides service to telephones or
videophones. Such a device may provide or facilitate both basic services
and supplementary services, such as call transfer, park, pick-up, and
hold.</p>

<p>High-Level Datalink Control</p>
<p>High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a bit-oriented code-transparent
synchronous data link layer protocol developed by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO). The original ISO standards for
HDLC are as follows:</p>
<p>ISO 3309-1979 -- Frame Structure<br />
ISO 4335-1979 -- Elements of Procedure<br />
ISO 6159-1980 -- Unbalanced Classes of Procedure<br />
ISO 6256-1981 -- Balanced Classes of Procedure<br />
The current standard for HDLC is ISO/IEC 13239:2002, which replaces all
of those standards.</p>
<p>HDLC provides both connection-oriented and connectionless service.</p>
<p>HDLC can be used for point-to-multipoint connections via the original
master-slave modes Normal Response Mode (NRM) and Asynchronous Response
Mode (ARM), but they are now rarely used; is now used almost exclusively
to connect one device to another, using Asynchronous Balanced Mode
(ABM).</p>

<p>Home Location Register</p>
<p>The home location register (HLR) is a central database that contains
details of each mobile phone subscriber that is authorized to use the
GSM core network. There can be several logical, and physical, HLRs per
public land mobile network (PLMN), though one international mobile
subscriber identity (IMSI)/MSISDN pair can be associated with only one
logical HLR (which can span several physical nodes) at a time.</p>
<p>The HLRs store details of every SIM card issued by the mobile phone
operator. Each SIM has a unique identifier called an IMSI which is the
primary key to each HLR record.</p>
<p>Another important item of data associated with the SIM are the MSISDNs,
which are the telephone numbers used by mobile phones to make and
receive calls. The primary MSISDN is the number used for making and
receiving voice calls and SMS, but it is possible for a SIM to have
other secondary MSISDNs associated with it for fax and data calls. Each
MSISDN is also a primary key to the HLR record. The HLR data is stored
for as long as a subscriber remains with the mobile phone operator.</p>
<p>Examples of other data stored in the HLR against an IMSI record is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GSM services that the subscriber has requested or been given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) settings to allow the subscriber
to access packet services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current location of subscriber (VLR and serving GPRS support
node/SGSN).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call divert settings applicable for each associated MSISDN.</p>
<p>The HLR is a system which directly receives and processes MAP
transactions and messages from elements in the GSM network, for
example, the location update messages received as mobile phones roam
around.</p>

<p>Hot Standby Router Protocol</p>
<p>In computer networking, the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) is a
Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant

1998. There is no RFC for version 2 of the protocol.</p>
<p>The protocol establishes an association between gateways in order to
achieve default gateway failover if the primary gateway becomes
inaccessible. HSRP gateways send multicast hello messages to other
gateways to notify them of their priorities (which gateway is preferred)
and current status (active or standby).<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="https"><a class="header" href="#https">HTTPS</a></h1>
<p>HTTP Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely
used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted
using Transport Layer Security (TLS), or formerly, its predecessor,
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also often
referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.</p>
<p>The principal motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the accessed
website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged
data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks.
The bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and
server protects against eavesdropping and tampering of the
communication. In practice, this provides a reasonable assurance that
one is communicating without interference by attackers with the website
that one intended to communicate with, as opposed to an impostor.</p>
<p>Historically, HTTPS connections were primarily used for payment
transactions on the World Wide Web, e-mail and for sensitive
transactions in corporate information systems. Since 2018, HTTPS is used
more often by webusers than the original non-secure HTTP, primarily to
protect page authenticity on all types of websites; secure accounts; and
keep user communications, identity, and web browsing private.</p>

<p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</p>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for
distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems.[1]
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks)
between nodes containing text. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or
transfer hypertext.</p>
<p>Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989.
Standards development of HTTP was coordinated by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
culminating in the publication of a series of Requests for Comments
(RFCs). The first definition of HTTP/1.1, the version of HTTP in common
use, occurred in RFC 2068 in 1997, although this was made obsolete by
RFC 2616 in 1999 and then again by the RFC 7230 family of RFCs in 2014.</p>
<p>A later version, the successor HTTP/2, was standardized in 2015, and is
now supported by major web servers and browsers over TLS using ALPN
extension where TLS 1.2 or newer is required</p>
<p>Example session<br />
Below is a sample conversation between an HTTP client and an HTTP server
running on <a href="http://www.example.com/">www.example.com</a>, port 80. As
mentioned in the previous sections, all the data is sent in a plain-text
(ASCII) encoding, using a two-byte CR LF ('<code>\r\n</code>{=tex}') line ending at
the end of each line.</p>

<p>In a half-duplex system, both parties can communicate with each other,
but not simultaneously; the communication is one direction at a time. An
example of a half-duplex device is a walkie-talkie two-way radio that
has a &quot;push-to-talk&quot; button; when the local user wants to speak to the
remote person they push this button, which turns on the transmitter but
turns off the receiver, so they cannot hear the remote person. To listen
to the other person they release the button, which turns on the receiver
but turns off the transmitter.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hash-function"><a class="header" href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h1>
<p>hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary
size to data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are
called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. Hash
functions are often used in combination with a hash table, a common data
structure used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash
functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated
records in a large file. One such application is finding similar
stretches in DNA sequences. They are also useful in cryptography. A
cryptographic hash function allows one to easily verify that some input
data maps to a given hash value, but if the input data is unknown, it is
deliberately difficult to reconstruct it (or any equivalent
alternatives) by knowing the stored hash value. This is
used for assuring integrity of transmitted data, and is the building
block for HMACs, which provide message authentication.</p>
<p>Hash functions are related to (and often confused with) checksums, check
digits, fingerprints, lossy compression, randomization functions,
error-correcting codes, and ciphers. Although the concepts overlap to
some extent, each one has its own uses and requirements and is designed
and optimized differently. The HashKeeper database maintained by the
American National Drug Intelligence Center, for instance, is more aptly
described as a catalogue of file fingerprints than of hash values.<br />

<p>An Ethernet hub, active hub, network hub, repeater hub, multiport
repeater, or simply hub is a network hardware device for connecting
multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single
network segment. It has multiple input/output (I/O) ports, in which a
signal introduced at the input of any port appears at the output of
every port except the original incoming. A hub works at the physical
layer (layer 1) of the OSI model. A repeater hub also participates in
collision detection, forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects
a collision. In addition to standard 8P8C (&quot;RJ45&quot;) ports, some hubs may
also come with a BNC or an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) connector to
allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.</p>
<p>Hubs are now largely obsolete, having been replaced by network switches
except in very old installations or specialized applications. As of
2011, connecting network segments by repeaters or hubs is deprecated by

<p>Information Assurance</p>
<p>Information assurance (IA) is the practice of assuring information and
managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission
of information or data and the systems and processes used for those
purposes. Information assurance includes protection of the integrity,
availability, authenticity, non-repudiation and confidentiality of user
data. It uses physical, technical and administrative controls to
accomplish these tasks. While focused predominantly on information in
digital form, the full range of IA encompasses not only digital but also
analog or physical form. These protections apply to data in transit,
both physical and electronic forms as well as data at rest in various
types of physical and electronic storage facilities. Information
assurance as a field has grown from the practice of information
security.</p>

<p>Interactive Connectivity Establishment</p>
<p>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a technique used in
computer networking to find ways for two computers to talk to each other
as directly as possible in peer-to-peer networking. This is most
commonly used for interactive media such as Voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP), peer-to-peer communications, video, and instant messaging. In
such applications, you want to avoid communicating through a central
server (which would slow down communication, and be expensive), but
direct communication between client applications on the Internet is very
tricky due to network address translators (NATs), firewalls, and other
network barriers.</p>
<p>ICE is developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force MMUSIC working
group and is published as RFC 5245, which has obsoleted RFC 4091</p>

<p>Internet Control Message Protocol</p>
<p>The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supporting protocol in
the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, including
routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating,
for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or
router could not be reached. ICMP differs from transport protocols such
as TCP and UDP in that it is not typically used to exchange data between
systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network applications
(with the exception of some diagnostic tools like ping and traceroute).</p>

<p>Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (for IPv6)</p>
<p>Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) is the
implementation of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). ICMPv6 is defined in RFC 4443.[1]
ICMPv6 is an integral part of IPv6 and performs error reporting and
diagnostic functions (e.g., ping), and has a framework for extensions to
implement future changes.</p>
<p>Several extensions have been published, defining new ICMPv6 message
types as well as new options for existing ICMPv6 message types. Neighbor
Discovery Protocol (NDP) is a node discovery protocol in IPv6 which
replaces and enhances functions of ARP.[2] Secure Neighbor Discovery
(SEND) is an extension of NDP with extra security. Multicast Listener
Discovery (MLD) is used by IPv6 routers for discovering multicast
listeners on a directly attached link, much like Internet Group
Management Protocol (IGMP) is used in IPv4. Multicast Router Discovery
(MRD) allows discovery of multicast routers.</p>

<p>Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB; known as &quot;mac-in-mac&quot;) is a set of
architecture and protocols for routing over a provider's network
allowing interconnection of multiple Provider Bridge Networks without
losing each customer's individually defined VLANs. It was initially
created by Nortel before being submitted to the IEEE 802.1 committee for
standardization. The final standard was approved by the IEEE in June
2008 as IEEE 802.1ah-2008 and has been integrated into IEEE 802.1Q-2011.</p>
<p>The idea of PBB is to offer complete separation of customer and provider
domains. For this purpose, a new Ethernet header has been defined. This
header may take multiple different forms, but the main components of the
header are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backbone component, that has:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backbone destination address (B-DA) (six bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backbone source address (B-SA) (six bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherType 0x88A8 (two bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B-TAG/B-VID (two bytes), this is the backbone VLAN indicator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service encapsulation, that has:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherType 0x88E7 (two bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flags that contain priority, Drop Eligible Indicator (DEI) and No
Customer Address (NCA) indication (e.g. OAM frames).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I-SID, the service identifier (three bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original customer frame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer destination address (six bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer source address (six bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherType 0x8100 (two bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer VLAN identifier (two bytes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherType (e.g. 0x0800)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer payload</p>
<p>PBB defines a 48 bit B-DA and 48 bit B-SA to indicate the backbone
source and destination MAC addresses. It also defines a 12 bit B-VID
(backbone VLAN ID) and 24 bit I-SID (Service Instance VLAN ID). The
bridges in the PBB domain switch based on the B-VID and B-DA values,
which contain 60 bits total. Bridges learn based on the B-SA and
ingress port value and hence is completely unaware of the customer
MAC addresses. I-SID allows distinguishing the services within a PBB
domain.</p>
<p>PBB is the foundation for the IEEE 802.1Qay PBB-TE standard, which
was standardized in 2009.</p>
<p>PBB is sometimes referred to as Mac-in-Mac.</p>

<p>Interior Gateway Protocol</p>
<p>An interior gateway protocol (IGP) is a type of protocol used for
exchanging routing information between gateways (commonly routers)
within an autonomous system (for example, a system of corporate local
area networks). This routing information can then be used to route
network-layer protocols like IP.</p>
<p>Interior gateway protocols can be divided into two categories:
distance-vector routing protocols and link-state routing protocols.
Specific examples of IGPs include Open Shortest Path First (OSPF),
Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Intermediate System to Intermediate
System (IS-IS) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).</p>

<p>Interior Gateway Routing Protocol</p>
<p>Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) is a distance vector interior
gateway protocol (IGP) developed by Cisco. It is used by routers to
exchange routing data within an autonomous system.</p>
<p>IGRP is a proprietary protocol. IGRP was created in part to overcome the
limitations of RIP (maximum hop count of only 15, and a single routing
metric) when used within large networks. IGRP supports multiple metrics
for each route, including bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability; to
compare two routes these metrics are combined together into a single
metric, using a formula which can be adjusted through the use of pre-set
constants. By default, the IGRP composite metric is a sum of the segment
delays and the lowest segment bandwidth. The maximum configurable hop
count of IGRP-routed packets is 255 (default 100), and routing updates
are broadcast every 90 seconds (by default). IGRP uses protocol number 9
for communication.</p>

<p>Internet Message Access Protocol</p>
<p>In computing, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet
standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from
a mail server over a TCP/IP connection. IMAP is defined by RFC 3501.</p>
<p>IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an
email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave
messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. An IMAP
server typically listens on port number 143. IMAP over SSL (IMAPS) is
assigned the port number 993.</p>
<p>Virtually all modern e-mail clients and servers support IMAP. IMAP and
the earlier POP3 (Post Office Protocol) are the two most prevalent
standard protocols for email retrieval, with many webmail service
providers such as Gmail, Outlook.com and Yahoo! Mail also providing
support for either IMAP or POP3.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="imsi"><a class="header" href="#imsi">IMSI</a></h1>
<p>International Mobile Subscriber Identity</p>
<p>The International Mobile Subscriber Identity or IMSI is used to identify
the user of a cellular network and is a unique identification associated
with all cellular networks. It is stored as a 64 bit field and is sent
by the phone to the network. It is also used for acquiring other details
of the mobile in the home location register (HLR) or as locally copied
in the visitor location register. To prevent eavesdroppers identifying
and tracking the subscriber on the radio interface, the IMSI is sent as
rarely as possible and a randomly generated TMSI is sent instead.</p>
<p>The IMSI is used in any mobile network that interconnects with other
networks. For GSM, UMTS and LTE networks, this number was provisioned in
the SIM card and for cdmaOne and CDMA2000 networks, in the phone
directly or in the R-UIM card (the CDMA equivalent of the SIM card).
Both cards have been superseded by the UICC.</p>
<p>An IMSI is usually presented as a 15 digit number but can be shorter.
For example, MTN South Africa's old IMSIs that are still being used in
the market are shown as 14 digits. The first 3 digits are the mobile
country code (MCC), which are followed by the mobile network code (MNC),
either 2 digits (European standard) or 3 digits (North American
standard). The length of the MNC depends on the value of the MCC, and it
is recommended that the length is uniform within a MCC area. The
remaining digits are the mobile subscription identification number
(MSIN) within the network's customer base (mostly 10 or 9 digits
depending on the MNC length).</p>
<p>The IMSI conforms to the ITU E.212 numbering standard.</p>

<p>IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem</p>
<p>The IP Multimedia Subsystem or IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem
(IMS) is an architectural framework for delivering IP multimedia
services. Historically, mobile phones have provided voice call services
over a circuit-switched-style network, rather than strictly over an IP
packet-switched network. Alternative methods of delivering voice (VoIP)
or other multimedia services have become available on smartphones, but
they have not become standardized across the industry. IMS is an
architectural framework to provide such standardization.</p>
<p>IMS was originally designed by the wireless standards body 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), as a part of the vision for
evolving mobile networks beyond GSM. Its original formulation (3GPP
Rel-5) represented an approach for delivering Internet services over
GPRS. This vision was later updated by 3GPP, 3GPP2 and ETSI TISPAN by
requiring support of networks other than GPRS, such as Wireless LAN,
CDMA2000 and fixed lines.</p>
<p>IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible, e.g., the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP). According to the 3GPP, IMS is not intended to
standardize applications, but rather to aid the access of multimedia and
voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals, i.e., to create
a form of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). This is done by having a
horizontal control layer that isolates the access network from the
service layer. From a logical architecture perspective, services need
not have their own control functions, as the control layer is a common
horizontal layer. However, in implementation this does not necessarily
map into greater reduced cost and complexity.</p>

<p>Intelligent Network</p>
<p>The Intelligent Network (IN) is the standard network architecture

to the standard telecom services such as PSTN, ISDN on fixed networks,
and GSM services on mobile phones or other mobile devices.</p>
<p>The intelligence is provided by network nodes on the service layer,
distinct from the switching layer of the core network, as opposed to
solutions based on intelligence in the core switches or equipment. The
IN nodes are typically owned by telecommunications service providers
such as a telephone company or mobile phone operator.</p>

<p>Intrusion Prevention Services</p>
<p>An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application
that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy
violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported
either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security
information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines
outputs from multiple sources, and uses alarm filtering techniques to
distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.</p>
<p>While there are several types of IDS, ranging in scope from single
computers to large networks,[1]. the most common classifications are
network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion
detection systems (HIDS). A system that monitors important operating
system files is an example of a HIDS, while a system that analyzes
incoming network traffic is an example of a NIDS. It is also possible to
classify IDS by detection approach: the most well-known variants are
signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware)
and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of &quot;good&quot;
traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Some IDS have the
ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response
capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention
system.</p>

<p>IP Security</p>
<p>In computing, Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a secure network
protocol suite of IPv4 that authenticates and encrypts the packets of
data sent over an IPv4 network. Because of the complexity or immaturity
of the IP security protocols, the initial IPv4 was developed without or
barely with security protocols such that the IP version was incomplete,
open or left for further research development. IPsec includes protocols
for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning
of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to use during the
session. IPsec can protect data flows between a pair of hosts
(host-to-host), between a pair of security gateways
(network-to-network), or between a security gateway and a host
(network-to-host).[1] Internet Protocol security (IPsec) uses
cryptographic security services to protect communications over Internet
Protocol (IP) networks. IPsec supports network-level peer
authentication, data-origin authentication, data integrity, data
confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection.</p>
<p>As a part of the IPv4 enhancement, IPsec is a layer 3 OSI model or
Internet Layer for an end-to-end security scheme operating in the
Internet Protocol Suite in version 4, while some other Internet security
systems in widespread use are above the layer 3, such as Transport Layer
Security (TLS) and Secure Shell (SSH), operate in the upper layers at
the Transport Layer (TLS) and the Application layer (SSH). IPsec can
automatically secure applications at the IP layer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="iptv"><a class="header" href="#iptv">IPTV</a></h1>
<p>Internet Protocol television</p>
<p>Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is the delivery of television
content over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. This is in contrast to
delivery through traditional terrestrial, satellite, and cable
television formats. Unlike downloaded media, IPTV offers the ability to
stream the source media continuously. As a result, a client media player
can begin playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately.
This is known as streaming media.</p>
<p>Although IPTV uses the Internet protocol it is not limited to television
streamed from the Internet, (Internet television). IPTV is widely
deployed in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-speed
access channels into end-user premises via set-top boxes or other
customer-premises equipment. IPTV is also used for media delivery around
corporate and private networks. IPTV in the telecommunications arena is
notable for its ongoing standardisation process (e.g., European
Telecommunications Standards Institute).</p>
<p>IPTV services may be classified into three main groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Live television and live media, with or without related
interactivity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time-shifted media: e.g. catch-up TV (replays a TV show that was
broadcast hours or days ago), start-over TV (replays the current TV
show from its beginning);</p>

<p>Internet Protocol version 6</p>
<p>Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the Internet
Protocol (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based
internetworking methods in the Internet, and was the first version
deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. It still routes most
Internet traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of a successor
protocol, IPv6. IPv4 is described in IETF publication RFC 791 (September
1981), replacing an earlier definition (RFC 760, January 1980).</p>
<p>IPv4 is a connectionless protocol for use on packet-switched networks.
It operates on a best effort delivery model, in that it does not
guarantee delivery, nor does it assure proper sequencing or avoidance of
duplicate delivery. These aspects, including data integrity, are
addressed by an upper layer transport protocol, such as the Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP).<br />

<p>Internet Protocol version 4</p>
<p>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the
Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an
identification and location system for computers on networks and routes
traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem
of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4. IPv6
became a Draft Standard in December 1998, and became an Internet
Standard on 14 July 2017.</p>
<p>Every device on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address for
identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the
Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that
far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4
address space had available. By 1998, the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a 128-bit
address, theoretically allowing 2128, or approximately 3.4×1038
addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are
reserved for special use or completely excluded from use. The total
number of possible IPv6 addresses is more than 7.9×1028 times as many as
IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses and provides approximately 4.3 billion
addresses. The two protocols are not designed to be interoperable,
complicating the transition to IPv6. However, several IPv6 transition
mechanisms have been devised to permit communication between IPv4 and
IPv6 hosts.</p>
<p>IPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger
addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address
allocation methods that facilitate route aggregation across the
Internet, and thus limit the expansion of routing tables. The use of
multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional
optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security,
and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the
protocol.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal
digits with the groups being separated by colons, for example
2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, but methods to abbreviate this
full notation exist.<br />

<p>Integrated Services Digital Network</p>
<p>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a set of communication
standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data,
and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public
switched telephone network. It was first defined in 1988 in the CCITT
red book.[1] Prior to ISDN, the telephone system was viewed as a way
to transport voice, with some special services available for data. The
key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same
lines, adding features that were not available in the classic telephone
system. The ISDN standards define several kinds of access interfaces,
such as Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI),
Narrowband ISDN (N-ISDN), and Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN).</p>
<p>ISDN is a circuit-switched telephone network system, which also provides
access to packet switched networks, designed to allow digital
transmission of voice and data over ordinary telephone copper wires,
resulting in potentially better voice quality than an analog phone can
provide. It offers circuit-switched connections (for either voice or
data), and packet-switched connections (for data), in increments of 64
kilobit/s. In some countries, ISDN found major market application for
Internet access, in which ISDN typically provides a maximum of 128
kbit/s bandwidth in both upstream and downstream directions. Channel
bonding can achieve a greater data rate; typically the ISDN B-channels
of three or four BRIs (six to eight 64 kbit/s channels) are bonded.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="isup"><a class="header" href="#isup">ISUP</a></h1>
<p>The ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) User Part or ISUP is part
of Signaling System No. 7 (SS7), which is used to set up telephone calls
in the public switched telephone network (PSTN). It is specified by the
ITU-T as part of the Q.76x series.</p>
<p>When a telephone call is set up from one subscriber to another, several
telephone exchanges could be involved, possibly across international
boundaries. To allow a call to be set up correctly, where ISUP is
supported, a switch will signal call-related information like called
party number to the next switch in the network using ISUP messages.</p>
<p>The telephone exchanges may be connected via E1 or T1 trunks which
transport the speech from the calls. These trunks are divided into 64
kbit/s timeslots, and one timeslot can carry exactly one call.
Regardless of what facilities are used to interconnect switches, each
circuit between two switches is uniquely identified by a circuit
identification code (CIC) that is included in the ISUP messages. The
exchange uses this information along with the received signaling
information (especially the called party number) to determine which
inbound and outbound circuits should be connected together to provide an
end to end speech path.</p>
<p>In addition to call related information, ISUP is also used to exchange
status information for, and permit management of, the available
circuits. In the case of no outbound circuit being available on a
particular exchange, a release message is sent back to the preceding
switches in the chain.</p>

<p>TIL (formerly an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure
Library) is a set of detailed practices for IT service management (ITSM)
that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business. In its
current form (known as ITIL 2011), ITIL is published as a series of five
core volumes, each of which covers a different ITSM lifecycle stage.
Although ITIL underpins ISO/IEC 20000 (previously BS 15000), the
International Service Management Standard for IT service management,
there are some differences between the ISO 20000 standard, ICT Standard
by IFGICT and the ITIL framework.</p>
<p>ITIL describes processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists which are
not organization-specific or technology-specific, but can be applied by
an organization for establishing integration with the organization's
strategy, delivering value, and maintaining a minimum level of
competency. It allows the organization to establish a baseline from
which it can plan, implement, and measure. It is used to demonstrate
compliance and to measure improvement.</p>

is responsible for issues that concern information and communication
technologies.[1]</p>
<p>The ITU coordinates the shared global use of the radio spectrum,
promotes international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, works
to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world, and
assists in the development and coordination of worldwide technical
standards. The ITU is active in areas including broadband Internet,
latest-generation wireless technologies, aeronautical and maritime
navigation, radio astronomy, satellite-based meteorology, convergence in
fixed-mobile phone, Internet access, data, voice, TV broadcasting, and
next-generation networks. The agency also organizes worldwide and
regional exhibitions and forums, such as ITU Telecom World, bringing
together representatives of government and the telecommunications and

<p>The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of
communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer
networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational
protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and
the Internet Protocol (IP). It is occasionally known as the Department
of Defense (DoD) model because the development of the networking method
was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.</p>
<p>The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication
specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted,
routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four
abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to
the scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, the layers are
the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains
within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing
internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer,
handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer,
providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.</p>
<p>Technical standards specifying the Internet protocol suite and many of
its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). The Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a
more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="interpreted-language"><a class="header" href="#interpreted-language">Interpreted Language</a></h1>
<p>An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most
of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without
previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The
interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement
into a sequence of one or more subroutines, and then into another
language (often machine code).</p>
<p>The terms interpreted language and compiled language are not well
defined because, in theory, any programming language can be either
interpreted or compiled. In modern programming language implementation,
it is increasingly popular for a platform to provide both options.</p>
<p>Interpreted languages can also be contrasted with machine languages.
Functionally, both execution and interpretation mean the same thing ---
fetching the next instruction/statement from the program and executing
it. Although interpreted byte code is additionally identical to machine
code in form and has an assembler representation, the term &quot;interpreted&quot;
is practically reserved for &quot;software processed&quot; languages (by virtual
machine or emulator) on top of the native (i.e. hardware) processor.</p>
<p>In principle, programs in many languages may be compiled or interpreted,
emulated or executed natively, so this designation is applied solely
based on common implementation practice, rather than representing an
essential property of a language.</p>
<p>Many languages have been implemented using both compilers and
interpreters, including BASIC, C, Lisp, Pascal, and Python. Java and C#
are compiled into bytecode, the virtual-machine-friendly interpreted
language. Lisp implementations can freely mix interpreted and compiled
code.</p>

<p>An issue tracking system (also ITS, trouble ticket system, support
ticket, request management or incident ticket system) is a computer
software package that manages and maintains lists of issues, as needed
by an organization. Issue tracking systems are commonly used in an
organization's customer support call center to create, update, and
resolve reported customer issues, or even issues reported by that
organization's other employees. A support ticket should include vital
information for the account involved and the issue encountered. An issue
tracking system often also contains a knowledge base containing
information on each customer, resolutions to common problems, and other
such data. An issue tracking system is similar to a &quot;bugtracker&quot;, and
often, a software company will sell both, and some bugtrackers are
capable of being used as an issue tracking system, and vice versa.
Consistent use of an issue or bug tracking system is considered one of
the &quot;hallmarks of a good software team&quot;.</p>
<p>A ticket element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report
on a particular problem, its status, and other relevant data. They are
commonly created in a help desk or call center environment and almost
always have a unique reference number, also known as a case, issue or
call log number which is used to allow the user or help staff to quickly
locate, add to or communicate the status of the user's issue or request.</p>

<p>Internet Low Bitrate Codec</p>
<p>Internet Low Bitrate Codec (iLBC) is an open source royalty-free
narrowband speech audio coding format codec and reference
implementation, developed by Global IP Solutions (GIPS) formerly Global
IP Sound. It was formerly freeware with limitations on commercial use,
but since 2011 it is available under a free software/open source
(3-clause BSD license) license as a part of the open source WebRTC
project. It is suitable for VoIP applications, streaming audio, archival
and messaging. The algorithm is a version of block-independent linear
predictive coding, with the choice of data frame lengths of 20 and 30
milliseconds. The encoded blocks have to be encapsulated in a suitable
protocol for transport, usually the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).</p>
<p>iLBC handles lost frames through graceful speech quality degradation.
Lost frames often occur in connection with lost or delayed IP packets.
Ordinary low-bitrate codecs exploit dependencies between speech frames,
which cause errors to propagate when packets are lost or delayed. In
contrast, iLBC-encoded speech frames are independent and so this problem
will not occur.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="java"><a class="header" href="#java">Java</a></h1>
<p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is
concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to
have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to
let application developers &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; (WORA), meaning
that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically
compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most
popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web
applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally
developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been
acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component
of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its
syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either
of them.</p>
<p>The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual
machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under
proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the
specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its
Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also
developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as
the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard
libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="javascript"><a class="header" href="#javascript">Javascript</a></h1>
<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted
programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as
dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.</p>
<p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies
of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus
is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
use it,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
engine to execute it.</p>
<p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and
prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with
text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the
DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as
networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the
host environment in which it is embedded.</p>
<p>Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript
engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including

<p>Jitter buffers or de-jitter buffers are used to counter jitter
introduced by queuing in packet switched networks so that a continuous
playout of audio (or video) transmitted over the network can be ensured.
The maximum jitter that can be countered by a de-jitter buffer is equal
to the buffering delay introduced before starting the play-out of the
mediastream. In the context of packet-switched networks, the term packet
delay variation is often preferred over jitter.</p>
<p>Some systems use sophisticated delay-optimal de-jitter buffers that are
capable of adapting the buffering delay to changing network jitter
characteristics. These are known as adaptive de-jitter buffers and the
adaptation logic is based on the jitter estimates computed from the
arrival characteristics of the media packets. Adaptive de-jittering
involves introducing discontinuities in the media play-out, which may
appear offensive to the listener or viewer. Adaptive de-jittering is
usually carried out for audio play-outs that feature a VAD/DTX encoded
audio, that allows the lengths of the silence periods to be adjusted,
thus minimizing the perceptual impact of the adaptation.</p>
<p>Packet jitter in computer networks<br />
In the context of computer networks, jitter is the variation in latency
as measured in the variability over time of the packet latency across a
network. A network with constant latency has no variation (or jitter).
Packet jitter is expressed as an average of the deviation from the
network mean latency. However, for this use, the term is imprecise. The
standards-based term is &quot;packet delay variation&quot; (PDV). PDV is an
important quality of service factor in assessment of network
performance.</p>
<p>Burst transmission or burstiness, i.e. transmitting a burst of traffic
at a high rate followed by an interval or period of lower or zero rate
transmission, may also be seen as a form of jitter, as it represents a
deviation from the average transmission rate. However, unlike the jitter
caused by variation in latency, transmitting in bursts is commonly seen
a desirable feature, e.g. in variable bitrate transmissions.
Usage/Network Parameter Control (UPC and NPC), as implemented in ATM
networks, allows both a Maximum Burst Size (MBS) parameter on the
average or Sustained Cell Rate (SCR), and a Cell Delay Variation
tolerance (CDVt) on the Peak Cell Rate (PCR) at which the bursts are
transmitted. This MBS can be derived from or used to derive the maximum
variation between the arrival time of traffic in the bursts from the
time it would arrive at the SCR, i.e. a jitter about that SCR.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="jitter"><a class="header" href="#jitter">Jitter</a></h1>
<p>In electronics and telecommunications, jitter is the deviation from true
periodicity of a presumably periodic signal, often in relation to a
reference clock signal. In clock recovery applications it is called
timing jitter. Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in
the design of almost all communications links.</p>
<p>Jitter can be quantified in the same terms as all time-varying signals,
e.g., root mean square (RMS), or peak-to-peak displacement. Also like
other time-varying signals, jitter can be expressed in terms of spectral
density.</p>
<p>Jitter period is the interval between two times of maximum effect (or
minimum effect) of a signal characteristic that varies regularly with
time. Jitter frequency, the more commonly quoted figure, is its inverse.
ITU-T G.810 classifies jitter frequencies below 10 Hz as wander and
frequencies at or above 10 Hz as jitter.</p>
<p>Jitter may be caused by electromagnetic interference and crosstalk with
carriers of other signals. Jitter can cause a display monitor to
flicker, affect the performance of processors in personal computers,
introduce clicks or other undesired effects in audio signals, and cause
loss of transmitted data between network devices. The amount of
tolerable jitter depends on the affected application.<br />

<p>Key Performance Indicator</p>
<p>A performance indicator or key performance indicator (KPI) is a type of
performance measurement. KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or
of a particular activity (such as projects, programs, products and other
initiatives) in which it engages.</p>
<p>Often success is simply the repeated, periodic achievement of some
levels of operational goal (e.g. zero defects, 10/10 customer
satisfaction, etc.), and sometimes success is defined in terms of making
progress toward strategic goals. Accordingly, choosing the right KPIs
relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the
organization.[citation needed] What is deemed important often depends
on the department measuring the performance -- e.g. the KPIs useful to
finance will differ from the KPIs assigned to sales.</p>
<p>Since there is a need to understand well what is important, various
techniques to assess the present state of the business, and its key
activities, are associated with the selection of performance indicators.
These assessments often lead to the identification of potential
improvements, so performance indicators are routinely associated with
'performance improvement' initiatives. A very common way to choose KPIs
is to apply a management framework such as the balanced scorecard.</p>

<p>Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol that works on the

to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. The protocol
was named after the character Kerberos (or Cerberus) from Greek
mythology, the ferocious three-headed guard dog of Hades. Its designers
aimed it primarily at a client--server model and it provides mutual
authentication---both the user and the server verify each other's
identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping
and replay attacks.</p>
<p>Kerberos builds on symmetric key cryptography and requires a trusted
third party, and optionally may use public-key cryptography during
certain phases of authentication. Kerberos uses UDP port 88 by default.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="kernel"><a class="header" href="#kernel">Kernel</a></h1>
<p>The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's
operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.
On most systems, it is one of the first programs loaded on start-up
(after the bootloader). It handles the rest of start-up as well as
input/output requests from software, translating them into
data-processing instructions for the central processing unit. It handles
memory and peripherals like keyboards, monitors, printers, and speakers.</p>
<p>The critical code of the kernel is usually loaded into a separate area
of memory, which is protected from access by application programs or
other, less critical parts of the operating system. The kernel performs
its tasks, such as running processes, managing hardware devices such as
the hard disk, and handling interrupts, in this protected kernel space.
In contrast, everything a user does is in user space: writing text in a
text editor, running programs in a GUI, etc. This separation prevents
user data and kernel data from interfering with each other and causing
instability and slowness, as well as preventing malfunctioning
application programs from crashing the entire operating system.</p>
<p>The kernel's interface is a low-level abstraction layer. When a process
makes requests of the kernel, it is called a system call. Kernel designs
differ in how they manage these system calls and resources. A monolithic
kernel runs all the operating system instructions in the same address
space for speed. A microkernel runs most processes in user
space, for modularity.<br />

<p>Layer 1</p>
<p>In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the physical layer
or layer 1 is the first and lowest layer. This layer may be implemented
by a PHY chip.</p>
<p>The physical layer consists of the electronic circuit transmission
technologies of a network. It is a fundamental layer underlying the
higher level functions in a network. Due to the plethora of available
hardware technologies with widely varying characteristics, this is
perhaps the most complex layer in the OSI architecture.</p>
<p>The physical layer defines the means of transmitting raw bits rather
than logical data packets over a physical data link connecting network
nodes. The bitstream may be grouped into code words or symbols and
converted to a physical signal that is transmitted over a transmission
medium. The physical layer provides an electrical, mechanical, and
procedural interface to the transmission medium. The shapes and
properties of the electrical connectors, the frequencies to broadcast
on, the line code to use and similar low-level parameters, are specified
here.<br />

<p>Layer 2 Virtual Private Network</p>
<p>A Layer 2 MPLS VPN is a term in computer networking. It is a method that
Internet service providers use to segregate their network for their
customers, to allow them to transmit data over an IP network. This is
often sold as a service to businesses.</p>
<p>Layer 2 VPNs are a type of Virtual Private Network (VPN) that uses MPLS
labels to transport data. The communication occurs between routers that
are known as Provider Edge routers (PEs), as they sit on the edge of the
provider's network, next to the customer's network.</p>
<p>Internet providers who have an existing Layer 2 network (such as ATM or
Frame Relay) may choose to use these VPNs instead of the other common
MPLS VPN, Layer 3. There is no one IETF standard for Layer 2 MPLS VPNs.
Instead, two methodologies may be used. Both methods use a standard MPLS
header to encapsulate data. However, they differ in their signaling
protocols.</p>

<p>Layer 2</p>
<p>The data link layer, or layer 2, is the second layer of the seven-layer
OSI model of computer networking. This layer is the protocol layer that
transfers data between adjacent network nodes in a wide area network
(WAN) or between nodes on the same local area network (LAN) segment. The
data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer
data between network entities and might provide the means to detect and
possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer.</p>
<p>The data link layer is concerned with local delivery of frames between
nodes on the same level of the network. Data-link frames, as these
protocol data units are called, do not cross the boundaries of a local
network. Inter-network routing and global addressing are higher-layer
functions, allowing data-link protocols to focus on local delivery,
addressing, and media arbitration. This way, the data link layer is
analogous to a neighborhood traffic cop; it endeavors to arbitrate
between parties contending for access to a medium, without concern for
their ultimate destination. When devices attempt to use a medium
simultaneously, frame collisions occur. Data-link protocols specify how
devices detect and recover from such collisions, and may provide
mechanisms to reduce or prevent them.</p>
<p>Examples of data link protocols are Ethernet for local area networks
(multi-node), the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), HDLC and ADCCP for
point-to-point (dual-node) connections. In the Internet Protocol Suite
(TCP/IP), the data link layer functionality is contained within the link
layer, the lowest layer of the descriptive model.<br />

<p>Label Switched Path</p>
<p>A label-switched path (LSP) is a path through an MPLS network, set up by
a signaling protocol such as LDP, RSVP-TE, BGP (or the now deprecated
CR-LDP). The path is set up based on criteria in the FEC.</p>
<p>The path begins at a label edge router (LER), which makes a decision on
which label to prefix to a packet, based on the appropriate FEC. It then
forwards the packet along to the next router in the path, which swaps
the packet's outer label for another label, and forwards it to the next
router. The last router in the path removes the label from the packet
and forwards the packet based on the header of its next layer, for
example IPv4. Due to the forwarding of packets through an LSP being
opaque to higher network layers, an LSP is also sometimes referred to as
an MPLS tunnel.</p>
<p>The router which first prefixes the MPLS header to a packet is called an
ingress router. The last router in an LSP, which pops the label from the
packet, is called an egress router. Routers in between, which need only
swap labels, are called transit routers or label switch routers (LSRs).</p>
<p>Note that LSPs are unidirectional; they enable a packet to be label
switched through the MPLS network from one endpoint to another. Since
bidirectional communication is typically desired, the aforementioned
dynamic signaling protocols can set up an LSP in the other direction to
compensate for this.</p>

<p>Label Switched Router</p>
<p>An MPLS router that performs routing based only on the label is called a
label switch router (LSR) or transit router. This is a type of router
located in the middle of an MPLS network. It is responsible for
switching the labels used to route packets.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lte-4g"><a class="header" href="#lte-4g">LTE (4G)</a></h1>
<p>Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is a standard for high-speed wireless
communication for mobile devices and data terminals, based on the
GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies. It increases the capacity and speed
using a different radio interface together with core network
improvements. The standard is developed by the 3GPP (3rd Generation
Partnership Project) and is specified in its Release 8 document series,
with minor enhancements described in Release 9. LTE is the upgrade path
for carriers with both GSM/UMTS networks and CDMA2000 networks. The
different LTE frequencies and bands used in different countries mean
that only multi-band phones are able to use LTE in all countries where
it is supported.</p>
<p>LTE is commonly marketed as 4G LTE &amp; Advance 4G, but it does not meet
the technical criteria of a 4G wireless service, as specified in the
3GPP Release 8 and 9 document series for LTE Advanced. The requirements
were originally set forth by the ITU-R organization in the IMT Advanced
specification. However, due to marketing pressures and the significant
advancements that WiMAX, Evolved High Speed Packet Access and LTE bring
to the original 3G technologies, ITU later decided that LTE together
with the aforementioned technologies can be called 4G technologies. The
LTE Advanced standard formally satisfies the ITU-R requirements to be
considered IMT-Advanced.[4] To differentiate LTE Advanced and
WiMAX-Advanced from current 4G technologies, ITU has defined them as
&quot;True 4G&quot;</p>
<p>LTE-M</p>
<p>LTE-M (LTE-MTC [Machine Type Communication]), which includes eMTC
(enhanced Machine Type Communication), is a type of low power wide area
network (LPWAN) radio technology standard developed by 3GPP to enable a
wide range of cellular devices and services (specifically, for
machine-to-machine and Internet of Things applications). The
specification for eMTC (LTE Cat-M1) was frozen in 3GPP Release 13 (LTE
Advanced Pro), in June 2016. Other 3GPP IoT technologies include NB-IoT
and EC-GSM-IoT.</p>
<p>The advantage of LTE-M over NB-IoT is its comparatively higher data
rate, mobility, and voice over the network, but it requires more
bandwidth, is more costly, and cannot be put into guard band frequency
band for now. Compared to LTE Release 12 Cat-0 modem, an LTE-M model is
claimed to be 80% less expensive (in terms of the bill of materials),
support up to 18 dB better coverage, and a battery lifetime than can
last up to several years. In March 2019, the Global Mobile Suppliers
Association reported that over 100 operators had deployed/launched
either NB-IoT or LTE-M networks.</p>

<p>L2TP Tunnel Switch</p>
<p>L2TP tunnel switching, also known as L2TP multihop, simplifies the
deployment of an L2TP network across multiple domains. A router that
lies between a LAC and an LNS is configured as an L2TP tunnel switch
(LTS)---sometimes referred to simply as a tunnel switch or a tunnel
switching aggregator (TSA). The LTS is configured as both an LNS and a
LAC. When a remote LAC sends encapsulated PPP packets to the LNS
configured on the LTS, the LTS can forward or redirect the packets
through a different tunnel to a different LNS beyond the LTS. The
logical termination point of the original L2TP session is switched to a
different endpoint.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="latency"><a class="header" href="#latency">Latency</a></h1>
<p>Latency refers to a short period of delay (usually measured in
milliseconds) between when an audio signal enters and when it emerges
from a system. Potential contributors to latency in an audio system
include analog-to-digital conversion, buffering, digital signal
processing, transmission time, digital-to-analog conversion and the
speed of sound in the transmission medium.</p>
<p>Latency can be a critical performance metric in professional audio
including sound reinforcement systems, foldback systems (especially
those using in-ear monitors) live radio and television. Excessive audio
latency has the potential to degrade call quality in telecommunications
applications. Low latency audio in computers is important for
interactivity.</p>
<p>Telephone calls<br />
In all systems, latency can be said to consist of three elements: codec
delay, playout delay and network delay.</p>
<p>Latency in telephone calls is sometimes referred to as mouth-to-ear
delay; the telecommunications industry also uses the term quality of
experience (QoE). Voice quality is measured according to the ITU model;
measurable quality of a call degrades rapidly where the mouth-to-ear
delay latency exceeds 200 milliseconds. The mean opinion score (MOS) is
also comparable in a near-linear fashion with the ITU's quality scale -
defined in standards G.107 (page 800),G.108 and G.109 - with a quality
factor R ranging from 0 to 100. An MOS of 4 ('Good') would have an R
score of 80 or above; to achieve 100R requires an MOS exceeding 4.5.</p>
<p>Cellular calls<br />
The AMR narrowband codec, used currently in UMTS networks, is a low
bitrate, highly compressed, adaptive bitrate codec achieving rates from
4.75 to 12.2 kbit/s with 'toll quality' (MOS 4.0 or above) from 7.4
kbit/s. 2G networks use the AMR-12.2 codec, equivalent to GSM-EFR. As
mobile operators upgrade existing best-effort networks to support
concurrent multiple types of service over all-IP networks, services such
as Hierarchical Quality of Service (H-QoS) allow for per-user,
per-service QoS policies to prioritise time-sensitive protocols like
voice calls and other wireless backhaul traffic. Along with more
efficient voice codecs, this helps to maintain a sufficient MOS rating
whilst the volume of overall traffic on often oversubscribed mobile
networks increases with demand.</p>
<p>Another overlooked aspect of mobile latency is the inter-network
handoff; as a customer on Network A calls a Network B customer the call
must traverse two separate Radio Access Networks, two core networks and
an interlinking Gateway Mobile Switching Centre (GMSC) which performs
the physical interconnecting between the two providers.</p>
<p>IP calls<br />
On a stable connection with sufficient bandwidth and minimal latency,
VoIP systems typically have a minimum of 20 ms inherent latency and
target 150 ms as a maximum latency for general consumer use. With
end-to-end QoS managed and assured rate connections, latency can be
reduced to analogue PSTN/POTS levels. Latency is a larger consideration
in these systems when an echo is present therefore popular VoIP codecs
such as G.729 perform complex voice detection and noise suppression.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lawful-intercept"><a class="header" href="#lawful-intercept">Lawful intercept</a></h1>
<p>Lawful interception (LI) refers to the facilities in telecommunications
and telephone networks that allow law enforcement agencies with court
order or other legal authorization to selectively wiretap individual
subscribers. Most countries require licensed telecommunications
operators to provide their networks with Legal Interception gateways and
nodes for the interception of communications. The interfaces of these
gateways have been standardized by telecommunication standardization
organizations.</p>
<p>With the legacy public switched telephone network (PSTN), wireless, and
cable systems, lawful interception (LI) was generally performed by
accessing the mechanical or digital switches supporting the targets'
calls. The introduction of packet switched networks, softswitch
technology, and server-based applications the past two decades
fundamentally altered how LI is undertaken.</p>
<p>Lawful interception differs from the dragnet-type mass surveillance
sometimes done by intelligence agencies, where all data passing a
fiber-optic splice or other collection point is extracted for storage or
filtering. It is also separate from the data retention of metadata that
has become a legal requirement in some jurisdictions.</p>

<p>A leased line is a private bidirectional or symmetric telecommunications
circuit between two or more locations provided in exchange for a monthly
rent. Sometimes known as a private circuit or data line in the UK.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional PSTN lines they do not have telephone numbers, each
side of the line being permanently connected and dedicated to the other.
Leased lines can be used for telephone, Internet, or other data
services. Some are ringdown services, and some connect to a private
branch exchange or router.</p>
<p>Typically, leased lines are used by businesses to connect geographically
distant offices. Unlike dial-up connections, a leased line is always
active. The fee for the connection is a fixed monthly rate. The primary
factors affecting the monthly fee are distance between end points and
the speed of the circuit. Because the connection does not carry anybody
else's communications, the carrier can assure a given level of quality.</p>
<p>An Internet leased line is a premium Internet connectivity product,
normally delivered over fiber, which provides uncontended, symmetrical
speeds with full duplex. It is also known as an ethernet leased line,
dedicated line, data circuit or private line.</p>
<p>For example, a T1 can be leased and provides a maximum transmission
speed of 1.544 Mbit/s. The user can channelize the T1 to separate the 24
DS0 circuits for voice communication, partial the T1 for data and voice
communications, or multiplex the channels into a single data circuit.
Leased lines, as opposed to DSL, are being used by companies and
individuals for Internet access because they afford faster data transfer
rates and are cost-effective for heavy users of the Internet.</p>

<p>Linux is a family of free and open-source software operating systems
built around the Linux kernel. Typically, Linux is packaged in a form
known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and
server use. The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux
kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991,
by Linus Torvalds. Many Linux distributions use the word &quot;Linux&quot; in
their name. The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to
refer to the operating system family, as well as specific distributions,
to emphasize that most Linux distributions are not just the Linux
kernel, and that they have in common not only the kernel, but also
numerous utilities and libraries, a large proportion of which are from
the GNU project.<br />

languages, but more complicated or domain-specific features were not
included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language,
allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was intended to
be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused

<p>Lisp (historically, LISP) is a family of computer programming languages
with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix
notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest
high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is
older, by one year. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many
dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best known
general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme.</p>
<p>Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical
notation for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo
Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became the favored programming
language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As one of the
earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer
science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management,
dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the
self-hosting compiler, and the read--eval--print loop.</p>
<p>The name LISP derives from &quot;LISt Processor&quot;. Linked lists are one of
Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists.
Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure,
giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to
create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.</p>
<p>The interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly
recognizable syntax. All program code is written as s-expressions, or
parenthesized lists. A function call or syntactic form is written as a
list with the function or operator's name first, and the arguments
following; for instance, a function f that takes three arguments would
be called as (f arg1 arg2 arg3).</p>

<p>Machine to machine</p>
<p>Machine to machine (commonly abbreviated as M2M) refers to direct
communication between devices using any communications channel,
including wired and wireless. Machine to machine communication can
include industrial instrumentation, enabling a sensor or meter to
communicate the data it records (such as temperature, inventory level,
etc.) to application software that can use it (for example, adjusting an
industrial process based on temperature or placing orders to replenish
inventory). Such communication was originally accomplished by having a
remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for
analysis, which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal
computer.</p>
<p>More recent machine to machine communication has changed into a system
of networks that transmits data to personal appliances. The expansion of
IP networks around the world has made machine to machine communication
quicker and easier while using less power. These networks also allow new
business opportunities for consumers and suppliers.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mac-address"><a class="header" href="#mac-address">MAC Address</a></h1>
<p>Media Access Control Address</p>
<p>A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is a unique
identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for
communications at the data link layer of a network segment. MAC
addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network
technologies, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi. In this context, MAC
addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer.</p>
<p>A MAC may be referred to as the burned-in address (BIA). It may also be
known as an Ethernet hardware address (EHA), hardware address or
physical address (not to be confused with a memory physical address).</p>
<p>A network node may have multiple NICs and each NIC must have a unique
MAC address. Sophisticated network equipment such as a multilayer switch
or router may require one or more permanently assigned MAC addresses.</p>
<p>MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a NIC and
are stored in its hardware, such as the card's read-only memory or some
other firmware mechanism. A MAC address may include the manufacturer's
organizationally unique identifier (OUI). MAC addresses are formed
according to the rules of one of three numbering name spaces managed by
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE): MAC-48,
EUI-48, and EUI-64.[1][2] EUI is an abbreviation for Extended Unique
Identifier.</p>

<p>In computer networking, a media access control attack or MAC flooding is
a technique employed to compromise the security of network switches. The
attack works by forcing legitimate MAC table contents out of the switch
and forcing a unicast flooding behavior potentially sending sensitive
information to portions of the network where it is not normally intended
to go.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mac-spoofing"><a class="header" href="#mac-spoofing">MAC Spoofing</a></h1>
<p>MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access
Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. The
MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC)
cannot be changed. However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be
changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an operating
system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing.
The process of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing.

<p>Media Access Control</p>
<p>In IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards, the medium access control (MAC) sublayer
(also known as the media access control sublayer) and the logical link
control (LLC) sublayer together make up the data link layer. Within that
data link layer, the LLC provides flow control and multiplexing for the
logical link (i.e. EtherType, 802.1Q VLAN tag etc), while the MAC
provides flow control and multiplexing for the transmission medium.</p>
<p>These two sublayers together correspond to layer 2 of the OSI model. For
compatibility reasons, LLC is optional for implementations of IEEE 802.3
(the frames are then &quot;raw&quot;), but compulsory for implementations of all
other IEEE 802 standards. Within the hierarchy of the OSI model and IEEE
802 standards, the MAC block provides a control abstraction of the
physical layer such that the complexities of physical link control are
invisible to the LLC and upper layers of the network stack. Thus any LLC
block (and higher layers) may be used with any MAC. In turn, the medium
access control block is formally connected to the PHY via a
media-independent interface. Although the MAC block is today typically
integrated with the PHY within the same device package, historically any
MAC could be used with any PHY, independent of the transmission medium.</p>
<p>When sending data to another device on the network, the MAC block
encapsulates higher-level frames into frames appropriate for the
transmission medium (i.e. the MAC adds a syncword preamble and also
padding if necessary), adds a frame check sequence to identify
transmission errors, and then forwards the data to the physical layer as
soon as the appropriate channel access method permits it. Controlling
when data is sent and when to wait is necessary to avoid congestion and
collisions, especially for topologies with a collision domain (bus,
ring, mesh, point-to-multipoint topologies). Additionally, the MAC is
also responsible for compensating for congestion and collisions by
initiating retransmission if a jam signal is detected, and/or
negotiating a slower transmission rate if necessary. When receiving data
from the physical layer, the MAC block ensures data integrity by
verifying the sender's frame check sequences, and strips off the
sender's preamble and padding before passing the data up to the higher
layers.</p>

<p>Mobile Adhoc NETwork</p>
<p>A mobile ad hoc network (MANET), also known as wireless ad hoc network
or ad hoc wireless network, is a continuously self-configuring,
infrastructure-less network of mobile devices connected wirelessly.</p>
<p>Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction,
and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. Each
must forward traffic unrelated to its own use, and therefore be a
router. The primary challenge in building a MANET is equipping each
device to continuously maintain the information required to properly
route traffic.[4] Such networks may operate by themselves or may be
connected to the larger Internet. They may contain one or multiple and
different transceivers between nodes. This results in a highly dynamic,
autonomous topology.</p>
<p>MANETs are a kind of wireless ad hoc network (WANET) that usually has a
routable networking environment on top of a Link Layer ad hoc network.
MANETs consist of a peer-to-peer, self-forming, self-healing network.
MANETs circa 2000--2015 typically communicate at radio frequencies (30
MHz -- 5 GHz).<br />

<p>Message Digest 5</p>
<p>The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit
hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a
cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive
vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data
integrity, but only against unintentional corruption.</p>
<p>Like most hash functions, MD5 is neither encryption nor encoding. It can
be cracked by brute-force attack and suffers from extensive
vulnerabilities as detailed in the security section below.</p>
<p>MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash
function MD4.[3] The source code in RFC 1321 contains a &quot;by
attribution&quot; RSA license. The abbreviation &quot;MD&quot; stands for &quot;Message
Digest.&quot;</p>
<p>The security of MD5 has been severely compromised, with its weaknesses
having been exploited in the field, most infamously by the Flame malware
in 2012. The CMU Software Engineering Institute considers MD5
essentially &quot;cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use&quot;</p>

<p>Mixed-excitation linear prediction</p>
<p>Mixed-excitation linear prediction (MELP) is a United States Department
of Defense speech coding standard used mainly in military applications
and satellite communications, secure voice, and secure radio devices.
Its standardization and later development was led and supported by NSA,
and NATO.<br />
Compression level<br />
MELPe is intended for the compression of speech. Given an audio input
sampled at 8 kHz, the MELPe codec yields the following compression
ratios over a 64 kbit/s μ-Law G.711 datastream, discounting the effects
of protocol overhead:</p>
<p><img src="m/./images/14909510.png" alt="" /><br />
Generally, speech coding involves a trade-off of different aspects
including bit-rate, speech quality, delay (frame size and lookahead),
computational complexity, robustness to different speakers and
languages, robustness to different background noises, channel error
robustness, and also codec state recovery in the face of packet loss.
Since the MELPe's lower rates (600 and 1200 bit/s) are supersets of the
2400 bit/s rate, the algorithm complexity (e.g. in MIPS) is about the
same for all rates. The lower rates use increased frames and lookahead,
as well as codebook size, therefore they require more memory.  </p>

<p>Media Gateway Control Protocol</p>
<p>The Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) is a signaling and call
control communications protocol used in voice over IP (VoIP)
telecommunication systems. It implements the media gateway control
protocol architecture for controlling media gateways on Internet
Protocol (IP) networks connected to the public switched telephone
network (PSTN). The protocol is a successor to the Simple Gateway
Control Protocol (SGCP), which was developed by Bellcore and Cisco, and
the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC).</p>
<p>The methodology of MGCP reflects the structure of the PSTN with the
power of the network residing in a call control center softswitch which
is analogous to the central office in the telephone network. The
endpoints are low-intelligence devices, mostly executing control
commands and providing result indications in response. The protocol
represents a decomposition of other VoIP models, such as H.323, in which
the H.323 Gatekeeper, have higher levels of signaling intelligence.</p>
<p>MGCP is a text-based protocol consisting of commands and responses. It
uses the Session Description Protocol (SDP) for specifying and
negotiating the media streams to be transmitted in a call session and
the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for framing the media streams.<br />

<p>MP3 (formally MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III) is an
audio coding format for digital audio. Originally defined as the third
audio format of the MPEG-1 standard, it was retained and further
extended---defining additional bit rates and support for more audio
channels---as the third audio format of the subsequent MPEG-2 standard.
A third version, known as MPEG 2.5---extended to better support lower
bit rates---is commonly implemented, but is not a recognized standard.</p>
<p>MP3 (or mp3) as a file format commonly designates files containing an
elementary stream of MPEG-1 audio and video encoded data, without other
complexities of the MP3 standard.</p>
<p>In the aspects of MP3 pertaining to audio compression---the aspect of
the standard most apparent to end users (and for which is it best
known)---MP3 uses lossy data compression to encode data using inexact
approximations and the partial discarding of data. This allows a large
reduction in file size when compared to uncompressed audio. The
combination of small size and acceptable fidelity led to a boom in the
distribution of music over the Internet in the mid to late 1990s, as an
enabling technology when bandwidth and storage were still at a premium.
The MP3 format soon became associated with controversies surrounding
copyright infringement, music piracy, the file ripping/sharing
services <a href="http://mp3.com/">MP3.com</a> and Napster, among others. With the
advent of portable media players, a product category also including
smartphones, MP3 support remains near-universal.</p>
<p>MP3 compression works by reducing (or approximating) the accuracy of
certain components of sound that are considered to be beyond the hearing
capabilities of most humans. This method is commonly referred to as
perceptual coding, or psychoacoustic modeling. The remaining audio
information is then recorded in a space-efficient manner. Compared to
CD-quality digital audio, MP3 compression can commonly achieve a 75 to
95% reduction in size. For example, an MP3 encoded at a constant bitrate
of 128 kbit/s would result in a file approximately 9% the size of the
original CD audio.</p>

<p>Message Queuing Telemetry Transport</p>
<p>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC
PRF 20922) publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on top
of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote
locations where a &quot;small code footprint&quot; is required or the network
bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a
message broker.</p>
<p>Andy Stanford-Clark of IBM and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link authored the
first version of the protocol in 1999.</p>
<p>The specification does not specify the meaning of &quot;small code footprint&quot;
or the meaning of &quot;limited network bandwidth&quot;. Thus, the protocol's
availability for use depends on the context. In 2013, IBM submitted MQTT
v3.1 to the OASIS specification body with a charter that ensured only
minor changes to the specification could be accepted. MQTT-SN is a
variation of the main protocol aimed at embedded devices on non-TCP/IP
networks, such as ZigBee.</p>
<p>Historically, the &quot;MQ&quot; in &quot;MQTT&quot; came from IBM's MQ Series message
queuing product line.[6] However, queuing itself is not required to be

<p>Mobile switching center</p>
<p>The mobile switching center (MSC) is the primary service delivery node
for GSM/CDMA, responsible for routing voice calls and SMS as well as
other services (such as conference calls, FAX and circuit switched
data).</p>
<p>The MSC sets up and releases the end-to-end connection, handles mobility
and hand-over requirements during the call and takes care of charging
and real time prepaid account monitoring.</p>
<p>In the GSM mobile phone system, in contrast with earlier analogue
services, fax and data information is sent digitally encoded directly to
the MSC. Only at the MSC is this re-coded into an &quot;analogue&quot; signal
(although actually this will almost certainly mean sound is encoded
digitally as a pulse-code modulation (PCM) signal in a 64-kbit/s
timeslot, known as a DS0 in America).</p>
<p>There are various different names for MSCs in different contexts which
reflects their complex role in the network, all of these terms though
could refer to the same MSC, but doing different things at different
times.</p>
<p>The gateway MSC (G-MSC) is the MSC that determines which &quot;visited MSC&quot;
(V-MSC) the subscriber who is being called is currently located at. It
also interfaces with the PSTN. All mobile to mobile calls and PSTN to
mobile calls are routed through a G-MSC. The term is only valid in the
context of one call, since any MSC may provide both the gateway function
and the visited MSC function. However, some manufacturers design
dedicated high capacity MSCs which do not have any base station
subsystems (BSS) connected to them. These MSCs will then be the gateway
MSC for many of the calls they handle.</p>
<p>The visited MSC (V-MSC) is the MSC where a customer is currently
located. The visitor location register (VLR) associated with this MSC
will have the subscriber's data in it.</p>
<p>The anchor MSC is the MSC from which a handover has been initiated. The
target MSC is the MSC toward which a handover should take place. A
mobile switching center server is a part of the redesigned MSC concept
starting from 3GPP Release 4.</p>

unduplicated and in-sequence transport of SS7 messages between
communication partners.</p>
<p>MTP is formally defined primarily in ITU-T recommendations Q.701, Q.702,
Q.703, Q.704 and Q.705. Tests for the MTP are specified in the ITU-T
recommendations Q.781 for MTP2 and in Q.782 for MTP3. These tests are
used to validate the correct implementation of the MTP protocol.</p>
<p>Functional levels<br />
The SS7 stack can be separated into four functional levels: Level 1
through Level 3 comprise the MTP, and Level 4 the MTP user. MTP Level 3
is sometimes abbreviated MTP3; MTP Level 2, MTP2. MTP and SCCP are
together referred to as the Network Service Part (NSP).</p>
<p>There is no one-to-one mapping of MTP Levels 1 through 3 onto the OSI
model. Instead, MTP provides the functionality of layers 1, 2 and part
of layer 3 in the OSI model. The part of layer 3 of the OSI model that
MTP does not provide, is provided by SCCP or other Level 4 parts (MTP
users).</p>

<p>In computer networking, the maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the size
of the largest protocol data unit (PDU) that can be communicated in a
single network layer transaction. The MTU relates to, but is not
identical to the maximum frame size that can be transported on the data
link layer, e.g. Ethernet frame.</p>
<p>Larger MTU is associated with reduced overhead. Smaller MTU values can
reduce network delay. In many cases, MTU is dependent on underlying
network capabilities and must be adjusted manually or automatically so
as to not exceed these capabilities. MTU parameters may appear in
association with a communications interface or standard. Some systems
may decide MTU at connect time.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="machine-code"><a class="header" href="#machine-code">Machine code</a></h1>
<p>Machine code is a computer program written in machine language
instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's central
processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very
specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of
data in a CPU register or memory.</p>
<p>Machine code is a strictly numerical language which is intended to run
as fast as possible, and may be regarded as the lowest-level
representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a
primitive and hardware-dependent programming language. While it is
possible to write programs directly in machine code, it is tedious and
error prone to manage individual bits and calculate numerical addresses
and constants manually. For this reason, programs are very rarely
written directly in machine code in modern contexts, but may be done for
low level debugging, program patching, and assembly language
disassembly.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of practical programs today are written in
higher-level languages or assembly language. The source code is then
translated to executable machine code by utilities such as compilers,
assemblers, and linkers, with the important exception of interpreted
programs, which are not translated into machine code. However, the
interpreter itself, which may be seen as an executor or processor,
performing the instructions of the source code, typically consists of
directly executable machine code (generated from assembly or high-level
language source code).</p>
<p>Machine code is by definition the lowest level of programming detail
visible to the programmer, but internally many processors use microcode
or optimise and transform machine code instructions into sequences of
micro-ops, this is not generally considered to be a machine code per se</p>

<p>Telecommunications mediation is a process that converts call data to
pre-defined layouts that can be imported by a specific billing system or
other OSS applications<br />
A billing mediation platform is a system used to convert data of certain
datatypes to other datatypes, usually for billing purposes. Billing
Mediation Platforms are used mostly by telephone companies, who
typically need to process UDRs (Usage Detail Records). In call scenarios
UDRs are most often known as CDRs (Call Detail Records), and among
broadband carriers they are often referred to as IPDR<br />
Billing mediation platforms get their name from their behavior: they
&quot;mediate&quot; data between systems. In a typical telephone company scenario,
the systems providing data to the mediation platform are network
elements, such as telephone switches, and the systems receiving data
from the mediation platform perform accounting, auditing, archiving, or
bill-generation functions. The mediation system collects, collates and
prepares data for consumption by the downstream systems, which often
accept data only in a limited set of formats.<br />
Functionality<br />
Typically a mediation platform is used for the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Collection and validation of CDRs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtering out of non billing-relevant CDRs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correlation of different input sources CDRs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregation of partial CDRs related to the same call</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Format change and CDRs normalization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business transformation of data</p>
<p>In a telecom billing scenario, mediation is the first step after
receiving a CDR. The mediated CDR is forwarded to a rating engine,
which calculates the charge associated with the CDRs. In today's
world Rating Engines are more becoming necessary for the telecom
billing system to meet the growing variant customer needs for
different services.[citation needed]</p>
<p>Despite the name, not all of the data transferred via billing
mediation platforms is actually used for billing purposes. For
instance, the mediation software might generate traffic volume
statistics based on the number and origin of the records passing
through it. Those statistics could then be used for capacity
planning, as part of a network monitoring procedure, or for any
other business intelligence applications.</p>
<p>At core Mediation involves data transfer between various systems
with or without modification of data starting from Network elements
to OSS/BSS systems.</p>
<p>Sophisticated Billing Mediation software serves end to end
functionality for telecom operators. Mediation software performs
various operation from data collection to downstream distribution to
modules like retail billing, interconnect settlement, business
intelligence, fraud detection and revenue assurance.</p>

<p>Provisioning services for the subscription.</p>
<p>Complementary to Billing Mediation functions, comprehensive
mediation platforms also provide functionality dedicated to Service
Provisioning (the two areas frequently intermix as services
configured and used by the end customer result in usage data records
generation in the network).</p>
<p>Mediating between the systems is not the only job that Mediation
Platform can do. Actually this can be used as a provisioning agent.
The basic provisioning commands can be configured within the
mediation system and whenever we get a request for the system which
does the provisioning, the request can be converted into a file, in
which mediation can append the service provisioning commands and
send it to HLR for activating any request. This of course, load
dependent but can come very handy when there is a crisis in the
other system.</p>

<p>Modern mobile phone networks use cells because radio frequencies are a
limited, shared resource. Cell-sites and handsets change frequency under
computer control and use low power transmitters so that the usually
limited number of radio frequencies can be simultaneously used by many
callers with less interference.</p>
<p>A cellular network is used by the mobile phone operator to achieve both
coverage and capacity for their subscribers. Large geographic areas are
split into smaller cells to avoid line-of-sight signal loss and to
support a large number of active phones in that area. All of the cell
sites are connected to telephone exchanges (or switches), which in turn
connect to the public telephone network.</p>
<p>In cities, each cell site may have a range of up to approximately 1⁄2
mile (0.80 km), while in rural areas, the range could be as much as 5
miles (8.0 km). It is possible that in clear open areas, a user may
receive signals from a cell site 25 miles (40 km) away.</p>
<p>Since almost all mobile phones use cellular technology, including GSM,
CDMA, and AMPS (analog), the term &quot;cell phone&quot; is in some regions,
notably the US, used interchangeably with &quot;mobile phone&quot;. However,
satellite phones are mobile phones that do not communicate directly with
a ground-based cellular tower, but may do so indirectly by way of a
satellite.</p>
<p>There are a number of different digital cellular technologies,
including: Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet
Radio Service (GPRS), cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Evolution-Data Optimized
(EV-DO), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS), Digital Enhanced Cordless
Telecommunications (DECT), Digital AMPS (IS-136/TDMA), and Integrated
Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN). The transition from existing analog to
the digital standard followed a very different path in Europe and the
US.[11] As a consequence, multiple digital standards surfaced in the
US, while Europe and many countries converged towards the GSM standard.</p>

<p>In computer networking, multicast is group communication where data
transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers
simultaneously. Multicast can be one-to-many or many-to-many
distribution. Multicast should not be confused with physical layer
point-to-multipoint communication.</p>
<p>Group communication may either be application layer multicast or network
assisted multicast, where the latter makes it possible for the source to
efficiently send to the group in a single transmission. Copies are
automatically created in other network elements, such as routers,
switches and cellular network base stations, but only to network
segments that currently contain members of the group. Network assisted
multicast may be implemented at the data link layer using one-to-many
addressing and switching such as Ethernet multicast addressing,
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), point-to-multipoint virtual circuits
<a href="m/3">P2MP</a> or Infiniband multicast. Network assisted multicast may also
be implemented at the Internet layer using IP multicast. In IP multicast
the implementation of the multicast concept occurs at the IP routing
level, where routers create optimal distribution paths for datagrams
sent to a multicast destination address.</p>
<p>Multicast is often employed in Internet Protocol (IP) applications of
streaming media, such as IPTV and multipoint videoconferencing.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="multiplex"><a class="header" href="#multiplex">Multiplex</a></h1>
<p>In telecommunications and computer networks, multiplexing (sometimes
contracted to muxing) is a method by which multiple analog or digital
signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium. The aim is to
share a scarce resource. For example, in telecommunications, several
telephone calls may be carried using one wire. Multiplexing originated
in telegraphy in the 1870s, and is now widely applied in communications.
In telephony, George Owen Squier is credited with the development of
telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910.</p>
<p>The multiplexed signal is transmitted over a communication channel such
as a cable. The multiplexing divides the capacity of the communication
channel into several logical channels, one for each message signal or
data stream to be transferred. A reverse process, known as
demultiplexing, extracts the original channels on the receiver end.</p>
<p>A device that performs the multiplexing is called a multiplexer (MUX),
and a device that performs the reverse process is called a demultiplexer
(DEMUX or DMX).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mutex"><a class="header" href="#mutex">Mutex</a></h1>
<p>In computer science, a lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a
synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource
in an environment where there are many threads of execution. A lock is
designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mutual-exclusion"><a class="header" href="#mutual-exclusion">Mutual Exclusion</a></h1>
<p>In computer science, mutual exclusion is a property of concurrency
control, which is instituted for the purpose of preventing race
conditions; it is the requirement that one thread of execution never
enter its critical section at the same time that another concurrent
thread of execution enters its own critical section.</p>
<p>The requirement of mutual exclusion was first identified and solved by
Edsger W. Dijkstra in his seminal 1965 paper titled Solution of a
problem in concurrent programming control,[1][2] which is credited
as the first topic in the study of concurrent algorithms.</p>
<p>A simple example of why mutual exclusion is important in practice can be
visualized using a singly linked list of four items, where the second
and third are to be removed. The removal of a node that sits between 2
other nodes is performed by changing the next pointer of the previous
node to point to the next node (in other words, if node i is being
removed, then the next pointer of node i - 1 is changed to point to node
i + 1, thereby removing from the linked list any reference to node i).
When such a linked list is being shared between multiple threads of
execution, two threads of execution may attempt to remove two different
nodes simultaneously, one thread of execution changing the next pointer
of node i - 1 to point to node i + 1, while another thread of execution
changes the next pointer of node i to point to node i + 2. Although both
removal operations complete successfully, the desired state of the
linked list is not achieved: node i + 1 remains in the list, because the
next pointer of node i - 1 points to node i + 1.</p>
<p>This problem (called a race condition) can be avoided by using the
requirement of mutual exclusion to ensure that simultaneous updates to
the same part of the list cannot occur.</p>
<p>The term mutual exclusion is also used in reference to the simultaneous
writing of a memory address by one thread while the aforementioned
memory address is being manipulated or read by another thread or other
threads.</p>

<p>Network Address Port Translation</p>
<p>All IP packets have a source IP address and a destination IP address.
Typically packets passing from the private network to the public network
will have their source address modified, while packets passing from the
public network back to the private network will have their destination
address modified. To avoid ambiguity in how replies are translated,
further modifications to the packets are required. The vast bulk of
Internet traffic uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User
Datagram Protocol (UDP). For these protocols the port numbers are
changed so that the combination of IP address and port information on
the returned packet can be unambiguously mapped to the corresponding
private network destination. RFC 2663 uses the term network address and
port translation (NAPT) for this type of NAT. Other names include port
address translation (PAT), IP masquerading, NAT overload and many-to-one
NAT. This is the most common type of NAT and has become synonymous with
the term &quot;NAT&quot; in common usage.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="nat"><a class="header" href="#nat">NAT</a></h1>
<p>Network Address Translation</p>
<p>Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP
address space into another by modifying network address information in
the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic
routing device. The technique was originally used as a shortcut to avoid
the need to readdress every host when a network was moved. It has become
a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the
face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a
NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.</p>
<p>IP masquerading is a technique that hides an entire IP address space,
usually consisting of private IP addresses, behind a single IP address
in another, usually public address space. The address that has to be
hidden is changed into a single (public) IP address as &quot;new&quot; source
address of the outgoing IP packet so it appears as originating not from
the hidden host but from the routing device itself. Because of the
popularity of this technique to conserve IPv4 address space, the term
NAT has become virtually synonymous with IP masquerading.</p>
<p>As network address translation modifies the IP address information in
packets, it has serious consequences on the quality of Internet
connectivity and requires careful attention to the details of its
implementation. NAT implementations vary widely in their specific
behavior in various addressing cases and their effect on network
traffic. The specifics of NAT behavior are not commonly documented by
vendors of equipment containing NAT implementations.<br />

<p>In the 3GPP UTRAN architecture, NBAP (Node B Application Part) is the
signalling protocol responsible for the control of the Node B by the
RNC. NBAP is subdivided into Common and Dedicated NBAP (C-NBAP and
D-NBAP), where Common NBAP controls overall Node B functionality, and
Dedicated NBAP controls radio links to specific user equipment. NBAP
forms part of the Iub interface.</p>
<p>NBAP handles two kind of Procedures for different NBAP functionalities

BCCH Broadcast for creating new Node B Communication Context Dedicated
Procedures for handling procedures of an existing Node B Communication
Context in a TTP/CCP.</p>
<p>NB-IoT Narrowband IoT</p>
<p>Narrowband Internet of things (NB-IoT) is a low-power wide-area network
(LPWAN) radio technology standard developed by 3GPP for cellular devices
and services. The specification was frozen in 3GPP Release 13 (LTE
Advanced Pro), in June 2016. Other 3GPP IoT technologies include eMTC
(enhanced Machine-Type Communication) and EC-GSM-IoT.</p>
<p>NB-IoT focuses specifically on indoor coverage, low cost, long battery
life, and high connection density. NB-IoT uses a subset of the LTE
standard, but limits the bandwidth to a single narrow-band of 200kHz. It
uses OFDM modulation for downlink communication and SC-FDMA for uplink
communications. IoT applications which require more frequent
communications will be better served by NB-IoT, which has no duty cycle
limitations operating on the licensed spectrum.</p>
<p>The NB-IoT technology operates using resource blocks on existing LTE
networks or in the LTE carrier's guard bands. It can also operate using
unused 200 khz bands that were previously used by GSM.</p>

<p>Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol
originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984, allowing a user on a

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ngn"><a class="header" href="#ngn">NGN</a></h1>
<p>Next Generation Networks</p>
<p>The next-generation network (NGN) is a body of key architectural changes
in telecommunication core and access networks. The general idea behind
the NGN is that one network transports all information and services
(voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating
these into IP packets, similar to those used on the Internet. NGNs are
commonly built around the Internet Protocol, and therefore the term all
IP is also sometimes used to describe the transformation of formerly
telephone-centric networks toward NGN.</p>
<p>According to ITU-T, the definition is:</p>
<p>A next-generation network (NGN) is a packet-based network which can
provide services including Telecommunication Services and is able to
make use of multiple broadband, quality of Service-enabled transport
technologies and in which service-related functions are independent from
underlying transport-related technologies. It offers unrestricted access
by users to different service providers. It supports generalized
mobility which will allow consistent and ubiquitous provision of
services to users.<br />
From a practical perspective, NGN involves three main architectural
changes that need to be looked at separately:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the core network, NGN implies a consolidation of several
(dedicated or overlay) transport networks each historically built
for a different service into one core transport network (often based
on IP and Ethernet). It implies amongst others the migration of
voice from a circuit-switched architecture (PSTN) to VoIP, and also
migration of legacy services such as X.25, frame relay (either
commercial migration of the customer to a new service like IP VPN,
or technical emigration by emulation of the &quot;legacy service&quot; on the
NGN).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the wired access network, NGN implies the migration from the dual
system of legacy voice next to xDSL setup in local exchanges to a
converged setup in which the DSLAMs integrate voice ports or VoIP,
making it possible to remove the voice switching infrastructure from
the exchange.[2]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the cable access network, NGN convergence implies migration of
constant bit rate voice to CableLabs PacketCable standards that
provide VoIP and SIP services. Both services ride over DOCSIS as the
cable data layer standard.</p>
<p>In an NGN, there is a more defined separation between the transport
(connectivity) portion of the network and the services that run on
top of that transport. This means that whenever a provider wants to
enable a new service, they can do so by defining it directly at the
service layer without considering the transport layer --
i.e. services are independent of transport details. Increasingly
applications, including voice, tend to be independent of the access
network (de-layering of network and applications) and will reside
more on end-user devices (phone, PC, set-top box).</p>
<p>Underlying technology components<br />
Next-generation networks are based on Internet technologies
including Internet Protocol (IP) and multiprotocol label switching
(MPLS). At the application level, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
seems to be taking over from ITU-T H.323.</p>
<p>Initially H.323 was the most popular protocol, though its popularity
decreased in the &quot;local loop&quot; due to its original poor traversal of
network address translation (NAT) and firewalls. For this reason as
domestic VoIP services have been developed, SIP has been more widely
adopted. However, in voice networks where everything is under the
control of the network operator or telco, many of the largest
carriers use H.323 as the protocol of choice in their core
backbones.[citation needed] With the most recent changes
introduced for H.323, it is now possible for H.323 devices to easily
and consistently traverse NAT and firewall devices, opening up the
possibility that H.323 may again be looked upon more favorably in
cases where such devices encumbered its use previously. Nonetheless,
most of the telcos are extensively researching and supporting IP
Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which gives SIP a major chance of being
the most widely adopted protocol.</p>
<p>For voice applications one of the most important devices in NGN is a
Softswitch -- a programmable device that controls Voice over IP
(VoIP) calls. It enables correct integration of different protocols
within NGN. The most important function of the Softswitch is
creating the interface to the existing telephone network, PSTN,
through Signalling Gateways and Media Gateways. However, the
Softswitch as a term may be defined differently by the different
equipment manufacturers and have somewhat different functions.</p>
<p>One may quite often find the term Gatekeeper in NGN literature. This
was originally a VoIP device, which converted (using gateways) voice
and data from their analog or digital switched-circuit form (PSTN,
SS7) to the packet-based one (IP). It controlled one or more
gateways. As soon as this kind of device started using the Media
Gateway Control Protocol, the name was changed to Media Gateway
Controller (MGC).</p>
<p>A Call Agent is a general name for devices/systems controlling
calls.</p>
<p>The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a standardised NGN architecture
for an Internet media-services capability defined by the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).</p>

<p>Weighted Fair Queueing</p>
<p>See PWFQ<br />
Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) is a network scheduler scheduling
algorithm. WFQ is both a packet-based implementation of the generalized
processor sharing (GPS) policy, and a natural extension of fair queuing
(FQ). Whereas FQ shares the link's capacity in equal subparts, WFQ
allows schedulers to specify, for each flow, which fraction of the
capacity will be given.</p>
<p>Weighted fair queuing is also known as packet-by-packet GPS (PGPS or
P-GPS) since it approximates generalized processor sharing &quot;to within
one packet transmission time, regardless of the arrival patterns.&quot;<br />

<p>Network-to-network interface</p>
<p>See UNI<br />
In telecommunications, a network-to-network interface (NNI) is an
interface that specifies signalling and management functions between two
networks. An NNI circuit can be used for interconnection of signalling
(e.g., SS7), Internet Protocol (IP) (e.g., MPLS) or ATM networks.</p>
<p>In networks based on MPLS or GMPLS, NNI is used for the interconnection
of core Provider Routers (class 4 or higher). In the case of GMPLS, the
type of interconnection can vary across Back-to-Back, EBGP or mixed NNI
connection scenarios, depending on the type of VRF exchange used for
interconnection. In case of Back-to-Back, VRF is necessary to create
VLANs and subsequently sub-interfaces (VLAN headers and DLCI headers for
Ethernet and frame relay network packets) on each interface used for the
NNI circuit. In the case of eBGP NNI interconnection, P routers are
taught how to dynamically exchange VRF records without VLAN creation.
NNI also can be used for interconnection of two VoIP nodes. In cases of
mixed or full-mesh scenarios, other NNI types are possible.<br />

<p>Network News Transfer Protocol</p>
<p>The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is an application protocol
used for transporting Usenet news articles (netnews) between news
servers and for reading and posting articles by end user client
applications. Brian Kantor of the University of California, San Diego
and Phil Lapsley of the University of California, Berkeley wrote RFC
977, the specification for the Network News Transfer Protocol, in March
1986. Other contributors included Stan O. Barber from the Baylor College
of Medicine and Erik Fair of Apple Computer.</p>
<p>Usenet was originally designed based on the UUCP network, with most
article transfers taking place over direct point-to-point telephone
links between news servers, which were powerful time-sharing systems.
Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles
directly from the local disk.</p>
<p>As local area networks and Internet participation proliferated, it
became desirable to allow newsreaders to be run on personal computers
connected to local networks. The resulting protocol was NNTP, which
resembled the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) but was tailored for
exchanging newsgroup articles.</p>

<p>Network Time Protocol</p>
<p>Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock
synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched,
variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is
one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by
David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.</p>
<p>NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a
few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).[1]:3 It uses the
intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo's algorithm, to
select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of
variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens
of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than
one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions.
Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or
more</p>

<p>Network as a Service</p>
<p>Network as a service (NaaS) describes services for network transport
connectivity. NaaS involves the optimization of resource allocations by
considering network and computing resources as a unified whole</p>
<p>The term &quot;Network as a service&quot; (NaaS) is often used along with other
marketing terms like cloud computing, along with acronyms such as
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS),
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Communication-as-a-Service (CaaS).</p>
<p>NaaS sometimes includes the provision of a virtual network service by
the owners of the network infrastructure to a third party. Often this
includes network virtualization using a protocol such as OpenFlow.</p>
<p>Some service models are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Private Network (VPN): Extends a private network and the
resources contained in the network across networks like the public
Internet. It enables a host computer to send and receive data across
shared or public networks as if it were a private network with the
functionality and policies of the private network.</li>
<li>Bandwidth on demand (BoD): Technique by which network capacity is
assigned based on requirements between different nodes or users.
Under this model link rates can be dynamically adapted to the
traffic demands of the nodes connected to the link.</li>
<li>Mobile network virtualization: Model in which a telecommunications
manufacturer or independent network operator builds and operates a
network (wireless, or transport connectivity) and sells its
communication access capabilities to third parties (commonly mobile
phone operators) charging by capacity utilization. A mobile virtual
network operator (MVNO), is a mobile communications services
provider that does not own the radio spectrum or wireless network
infrastructure over which it provides services. Commonly a MVNO
offers its communication services using the network infrastructure
of an established mobile network operator.</li>

<p>Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.)
of a communication network.</p>
<p>Network topology is the topological[3] structure of a network and may
be depicted physically or logically. It is an application of graph
theory[4] wherein communicating devices are modeled as nodes and the
connections between the devices are modeled as links or lines between
the nodes. Physical topology is the placement of the various components
of a network (e.g., device location and cable installation), while
logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network. Distances
between nodes, physical interconnections, transmission rates, or signal
types may differ between two different networks, yet their topologies
may be identical. A network's physical topology is a particular concern
of the physical layer of the OSI model. Network topology can be used to
define or describe the arrangement of various types of telecommunication
networks, including command and control radio networks,[4] industrial
fieldbusses, and computer networks.</p>
<p>Examples of network typologies are found in local area networks (LAN), a
common computer network installation. Any given node in the LAN has one
or more physical links to other devices in the network; graphically
mapping these links results in a geometric shape that can be used to
describe the physical topology of the network. A wide variety of
physical topologies have been used in LANs, including ring, bus, mesh
and star. Conversely, mapping the data flow between the components
determines the logical topology of the network. In comparison,
Controller Area Networks, common in vehicles, are primarily distributed
control system networks of one or more controllers interconnected with
sensors and actuators over, invariably, a physical bus topology.<br />

<p>A NoSQL (originally referring to &quot;non SQL&quot; or &quot;non relational&quot;) database
provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled
in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the
&quot;NoSQL&quot; moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first
century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases
are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL
systems are also sometimes called &quot;Not only SQL&quot; to emphasize that they
may support SQL-like query languages.</p>
<p>Motivations for this approach include: simplicity of design, simpler
&quot;horizontal&quot; scaling to clusters of machines (which is a
problem for relational databases), and finer control over availability.
The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, wide
column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in
relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The
particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem
it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are
also viewed as &quot;more flexible&quot; than relational database tables.</p>
<p>Many NoSQL stores compromise consistency (in the sense of the CAP
theorem) in favor of availability, partition tolerance, and speed.
Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL stores include the use of
low-level query languages (instead of SQL, for instance the lack of
ability to perform ad-hoc joins across tables), lack of standardized
interfaces, and huge previous investments in existing relational
databases.[ Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions, although a
few databases, such as MarkLogic, Aerospike, FairCom c-treeACE, Google
Spanner (though technically a NewSQL database), Symas LMDB, and OrientDB
have made them central to their designs. (See ACID and join support.)</p>
<p>Instead, most NoSQL databases offer a concept of &quot;eventual consistency&quot;
in which database changes are propagated to all nodes &quot;eventually&quot;
(typically within milliseconds) so queries for data might not return
updated data immediately or might result in reading data that is not
accurate, a problem known as stale reads. Additionally, some NoSQL
systems may exhibit lost writes and other forms of data loss. Some NoSQL
systems provide concepts such as write-ahead logging to avoid data
loss. For distributed transaction processing across multiple databases,
data consistency is an even bigger challenge that is difficult for both
NoSQL and relational databases. Even current relational databases &quot;do
not allow referential integrity constraints to span databases.&quot; There
are few systems that maintain both ACID transactions and X/Open XA
standards for distributed transaction processing.</p>

<p>Node B corresponds to BTS (base transceiver station) in GSM.</p>
<p>Functionality<br />
This is the hardware that is connected to the mobile phone network that
communicates directly with mobile handsets. In contrast with GSM base
stations, Node B uses WCDMA/TD-SCDMA as the air interface technology. As
in all cellular systems, such as UMTS and GSM, the Node B contains radio
frequency transmitter(s) and the receiver(s) used to communicate
directly with mobile devices, which move freely around it. In this type
of cellular network, the mobile devices cannot communicate directly with
each other but have to communicate with the NodeB.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the Node Bs have minimum functionality, and are
controlled by an RNC (Radio Network Controller). However, this is
changing with the emergence of High Speed Downlink Packet Access
(HSDPA), where some logic (e.g., retransmission) is handled on the Node
B for lower response times.</p>

known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures
can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which
they are associated (objects have a notion of &quot;this&quot; or &quot;self&quot;). In OOP,
computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that
interact with one another. There is significant diversity of OOP
languages, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that
objects are instances of classes, which typically also determine their
type.</p>

at any given bitrate until transparency is reached, including MP3, AAC,
and HE-AAC.</p>
<p>Opus combines the speech-oriented linear predictive coding SILK
algorithm and the lower-latency, MDCT-based CELT algorithm, switching
between or combining them as needed for maximal efficiency. Bitrate,
audio bandwidth, complexity, and algorithm can all be adjusted
seamlessly in each frame. Opus has the low algorithmic delay (26.5 ms by
default) necessary for use as part of a real-time communication link,
permitting natural conversation, networked music performances, and live
lip sync; by trading-off quality or bitrate, the delay can be reduced
down to 5 ms. Its delay is exceptionally low compared to competing
codecs, which require well over 100 ms, yet Opus performs very
competitively with these formats in terms of quality per bitrate</p>

<p>macOS (previously Mac OS X and later OS X) is a series of graphical
operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is
the primary operating system for Apple's Mac family of computers. Within
the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, it
is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>macOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems. The
first is colloquially called the &quot;classic&quot; Mac OS, which was introduced
in 1984, and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999. The first
desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, with its
first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. After this, Apple began
naming its releases after big cats, which lasted until OS X 10.8
Mountain Lion. Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks, releases have been named after
landmarks in California. Apple shortened the name to &quot;OS X&quot; in 2012 and
then changed it to &quot;macOS&quot; in 2016, adopting the nomenclature that they
were using for their other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
The latest version is macOS High Sierra, which was publicly released in
September 2017.</p>

<p>Open Shortest Path First</p>
<p>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet
Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and
falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating
within a single autonomous system (AS). It is defined as OSPF Version 2
in RFC 2328 (1998) for IPv4. The updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF
Version 3 in RFC 5340 (2008). OSPF supports the Classless Inter-Domain
Routing (CIDR) addressing model.</p>
<p>OSPF is a widely used IGP in large enterprise networks. IS-IS, another
LSR-based protocol, is more common in large service provider networks.</p>

support management functions such as network inventory, service
provisioning, network configuration and fault management.</p>
<p>Together with business support systems (BSS), they are used to support
various end-to-end telecommunication services. BSS and OSS have their
own data and service responsibilities. The two systems together are
often abbreviated OSS/BSS, BSS/OSS or simply B/OSS.</p>
<p>The abbreviation OSS is also used in a singular form to refer to all the
Operations Support Systems viewed as a whole system.</p>
<p>Different subdivisions of OSS have been proposed by the TM Forum,

<p>In computer networking, out-of-order delivery is the delivery of data
packets in a different order from which they were sent. Out-of-order
delivery can be caused by packets following multiple paths through a
network, or via parallel processing paths within network equipment that
are not designed to ensure that packet ordering is preserved. One of the
functions of TCP is to prevent the out-of-order delivery of data, either
by reassembling packets into order or forcing retries of out-of-order
packets.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="overlap-dialling"><a class="header" href="#overlap-dialling">Overlap Dialling</a></h1>
<p>Overlap dialing is required by CAS signaled lines. Overlap dial provides
for a longer time-out period between digits, also called the inter-digit
timer. With overlap dial set to off, the gateway expects to receive the
digits one right after the other coming in to this line with very little
delay between digits. With overlap dial set to on, then the device waits
up to about 2 seconds between digits.</p>
<p>Basically overlap dialing is a mechanism where a destination number can
be specified partially to complete the first stage of a routing path.
For example, if the number was &quot;23168104&quot;, it may be possible for the
telecom to dial &quot;23168&quot; to reach the first port of call as quickly as
possible (to save time on sending the remaining 3 digits) and then
deliver the remaining 3 digits &quot;104&quot; in overlap mode.</p>

<p>Password Authentication Protocol</p>
<p>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is a password-based
authentication protocol used by Point to Point Protocol (PPP) to
validate users. Almost all network operating system remote servers
support PAP.</p>
<p>PAP is considered a weak authentication scheme (weak schemes are simple
and have lighter computational overhead but are much more vulnerable to
attack; while weak schemes may have limited application in some
constrained environments, they are avoided in general). Among PAP's
deficiencies is the fact that it transmits unencrypted passwords over
the network. PAP is therefore used only as a last resort when the remote
server does not support a stronger scheme such as CHAP or EAP</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pcm"><a class="header" href="#pcm">PCM</a></h1>
<p>Pulse-code modulation</p>
<p>Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent
sampled analog signals. It is the standard form of digital audio in
computers, compact discs, digital telephony and other digital audio
applications. In a PCM stream, the amplitude of the analog signal is
sampled regularly at uniform intervals, and each sample is quantized to
the nearest value within a range of digital steps.</p>
<p>Linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) is a specific type of PCM where the
quantization levels are linearly uniform. This is in contrast to PCM
encodings where quantization levels vary as a function of amplitude (as
with the A-law algorithm or the μ-law algorithm). Though PCM is a more
general term, it is often used to describe data encoded as LPCM.</p>
<p>A PCM stream has two basic properties that determine the stream's
fidelity to the original analog signal: the sampling rate, which is the
number of times per second that samples are taken; and the bit depth,
which determines the number of possible digital values that can be used
to represent each sample.</p>

<p>Policy and Charging Rules Function</p>
<p>Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) is the software node
designated in real-time to determine policy rules in a multimedia
network. As a policy tool, the PCRF plays a central role in
next-generation networks. Unlike earlier policy engines that were added
onto an existing network to enforce policy, the PCRF is a software
component that operates at the network core and accesses subscriber
databases and other specialized functions, such as a charging system, in
a centralized manner. Because it operates in real time, the PCRF has an
increased strategic significance and broader potential role than
traditional policy engines. This has led to a proliferation of PCRF
products since 2008.</p>
<p>The PCRF is the part of the network architecture that aggregates
information to and from the network, operational support systems, and
other sources (such as portals) in real time, supporting the creation of
rules and then automatically making policy decisions for each subscriber
active on the network. Such a network might offer multiple services,
quality of service (QoS) levels, and charging rules. PCRF can provide a
network agnostic solution (wire line and wireless) and can also enable
multi-dimensional approach which helps in creating a lucrative and
innovative platform for operators. PCRF can also be integrated with
different platforms like billing, rating, charging, and subscriber
database or can also be deployed as a standalone entity.</p>
<p>PCRF plays a key role in VoLTE as a mediator of network resources for
the IP Multimedia Systems network for establishing the calls and
allocating the requested bandwidth to the call bearer with configured
attributes.</p>

<p>plesiochronous digital hierarchy</p>
<p>The plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) is a technology used in
telecommunications networks to transport large quantities of data over
digital transport equipment such as fibre optic and microwave radio
systems. The term plesiochronous is derived from Greek plēsios, meaning
near, and chronos, time, and refers to the fact that PDH networks run in
a state where different parts of the network are nearly, but not quite
perfectly, synchronized.</p>
<p>Backbone transport networks replaced PDH networks with synchronous
digital hierarchy (SDH) or synchronous optical networking (SONET)
equipment over the ten years ending around the turn of the millennium
(2000), whose floating payloads relaxed the more stringent timing
requirements of PDH network technology.</p>
<p>PDH allows transmission of data streams that are nominally running at
the same rate, but allowing some variation on the speed around a nominal
rate. By analogy, any two watches are nominally running at the same
rate, clocking up 60 seconds every minute. However, there is no link
between watches to guarantee that they run at exactly the same rate, and
it is highly likely that one is running slightly faster than the other.</p>

A PDU may contain user data or control information and network
addressing. In layered architectures of communication protocol stacks,
each layer implements protocols tailored to the specific type or mode of
data exchange, or network function of the layer. For example, the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) implements a connection-oriented
transfer mode, and the PDU of this protocol is called a segment, while
the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) uses datagrams as protocol data unit
for connection-less transfer. A layer lower in the Internet Protocol
Suite, at the Internet Layer, the PDU is called a packet, irrespective
of its payload type.<br />

<p>Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol</p>
<p>The Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol, also known as
Protected EAP or simply PEAP, is a protocol that encapsulates the
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) within an encrypted and
authenticated Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel. The purpose was to
correct deficiencies in EAP; EAP assumed a protected communication
channel, such as that provided by physical security, so facilities for
protection of the EAP conversation were not provided.</p>
<p>PEAP was jointly developed by Cisco Systems, Microsoft, and RSA
Security. PEAPv0 was the version included with Microsoft Windows XP and
was nominally defined in draft-kamath-pppext-peapv0-00. PEAPv1 and
PEAPv2 were defined in different versions of
draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap. PEAPv1 was defined in
draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-00 through
draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-05, and PEAPv2 was defined in
versions beginning with draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-06.</p>

<p>Packed Encoding Rules</p>
<p>Packed Encoding Rules (PER) are ASN.1 encoding rules for producing a
compact transfer syntax for data structures described in ASN.1, defined
in 1994.</p>
<p>This Recommendation or International Standard describes a set of
encoding rules that can be applied to values of all ASN.1 types to
achieve a much more compact representation than that achieved by the BER
and its derivatives (described in ITU-T Rec. X.690 ISO/IEC 8825-1).</p>
<p>It uses additional information, such as the lower and upper limits for
numeric values, from the ASN.1 specification to represent the data units
using the minimum number of bits. The compactness requires that the
decoder knows the complete abstract syntax of the data structure to be
decoded, however.</p>
<p>There are two variations of packed encoding rules: unaligned and
aligned. With the unaligned encoding, the bits are packed with no regard
for octet (byte) boundaries. With aligned encoding, certain types of
data structures are aligned on octet boundaries, meaning there may be
some number of wasted padding bits. Unaligned encoding uses the least
number of bits, but presumably at some cost in processing time.</p>

Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced
by The PHP Group.[6] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but
it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
<p>PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in
combination with various web template systems, web content management
systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP
interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common
Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results
of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data,
including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be
executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to
implement standalone graphical applications.</p>
<p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free
software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and
can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and
platform, free of charge.</p>
<p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or
standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pll"><a class="header" href="#pll">PLL</a></h1>
<p>Phase Locked Loop</p>
<p>A phase-locked loop or phase lock loop abbreviated as PLL is a control
system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the
phase of an input signal. There are several different types; the
simplest is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency
oscillator and a phase detector in a feedback loop. The oscillator
generates a periodic signal, and the phase detector compares the phase
of that signal with the phase of the input periodic signal, adjusting
the oscillator to keep the phases matched.</p>
<p>Keeping the input and output phase in lock step also implies keeping the
input and output frequencies the same. Consequently, in addition to
synchronizing signals, a phase-locked loop can track an input frequency,
or it can generate a frequency that is a multiple of the input
frequency. These properties are used for computer clock synchronization,
demodulation, and frequency synthesis.</p>
<p>Phase-locked loops are widely employed in radio, telecommunications,
computers and other electronic applications. They can be used to
demodulate a signal, recover a signal from a noisy communication
channel, generate a stable frequency at multiples of an input frequency
(frequency synthesis), or distribute precisely timed clock pulses in
digital logic circuits such as microprocessors. Since a single
integrated circuit can provide a complete phase-locked-loop building
block, the technique is widely used in modern electronic devices, with
output frequencies from a fraction of a hertz up to many gigahertz.</p>

<p>PPP is used over many types of physical networks including serial cable,
phone line, trunk line, cellular telephone, specialized radio links, and
fiber optic links such as SONET. Internet service providers (ISPs) have
used PPP for customer dial-up access to the Internet, since IP packets
cannot be transmitted over a modem line on their own, without some data
link protocol.</p>
<p>Two derivatives of PPP, Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)

implementing virtual private networks, with many known security issues.
PPTP uses a TCP control channel and a Generic Routing Encapsulation
tunnel to encapsulate PPP packets.</p>
<p>The PPTP specification does not describe encryption or authentication
features and relies on the Point-to-Point Protocol being tunneled to
implement security functionality. However, the most common PPTP
implementation shipping with the Microsoft Windows product families
implements various levels of authentication and encryption natively as
standard features of the Windows PPTP stack. The intended use of this
protocol is to provide security levels and remote access levels
comparable with typical VPN products.<br />

<p>Primary Rate Interface</p>
<p>The Primary Rate Interface (PRI) is a telecommunications interface
standard used on an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) for
carrying multiple DS0 voice and data transmissions between the network
and a user.</p>
<p>PRI is the standard for providing telecommunication services to
enterprises and offices. It is based on T-carrier (T1) transmission in
the US, Canada, and Japan, while the E-carrier (E1) is common in Europe
and Australia. The T1 line consists of 23 bearer (B) channels and one
data (D) channel for control purposes, for a total bandwidth of
24x64-kbit/s or 1.544 Mbit/s. The E1 carrier provides 30 B- and two
D-channels for a bandwidth of 2.048 Mbit/s. The first timeslot on the E1
is used for synchronization purposes and is not considered to be a B- or
D-channel. The D-channel typically uses timeslot 16 on an E1, while it
is timeslot 24 for a T1. Fewer active bearer channels, sometimes called
user channels, may be used in fractional T1 or E1 services.</p>

<p>Public Switched Telephone Network</p>
<p>The public switched telephone network (PSTN) is the aggregate of the
world's circuit-switched telephone networks that are operated by
national, regional, or local telephony operators, providing
infrastructure and services for public telecommunication.<br />
The PSTN consists of telephone lines, fiber optic cables, microwave
transmission links, cellular networks, communications satellites, and
undersea telephone cables, all interconnected by switching centers, thus
allowing most telephones to communicate with each other.<br />
Originally a network of fixed-line analog telephone systems, the PSTN is
now almost entirely digital in its core network and includes mobile and
other networks, as well as fixed telephones<br />

<p>Precision Time Protocol</p>
<p>The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize
clocks throughout a computer network. On a local area network, it
achieves clock accuracy in the sub-microsecond range, making it suitable
for measurement and control systems.</p>
<p>PTP was originally defined in the IEEE 1588-2002 standard, officially
entitled &quot;Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for
Networked Measurement and Control Systems&quot; and published in 2002. In
2008, IEEE 1588-2008 was released as a revised standard; also known as
PTP Version 2, it improves accuracy, precision and robustness but is not
backward compatible with the original 2002 version.</p>
<p>&quot;IEEE 1588 is designed to fill a niche not well served by either of the
two dominant protocols, NTP and GPS. IEEE 1588 is designed for local
systems requiring accuracies beyond those attainable using NTP. It is
also designed for applications that cannot bear the cost of a GPS
receiver at each node, or for which GPS signals are inaccessible.&quot;</p>

efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices
using structured programming and data structuring. It is named in honor
of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal.</p>
<p>Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language. Wirth had
already developed several improvements to this language as part of the
ALGOL X proposals, but these were not accepted and Pascal was developed
separately and released in 1970. A derivative known as Object Pascal
designed for object-oriented programming was developed in 1985; this was
used by Apple Computer and Borland in the late 1980s and later developed
into Delphi on the Microsoft Windows platform. Extensions to the Pascal
concepts led to the Pascal-like languages Modula-2 and Oberon</p>

<p>Penetration Testing</p>
<p>A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test, is an authorized
simulated attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the
security of the system. The test is performed to identify both
weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the
potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's
features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment
to be completed.</p>
<p>The process typically identifies the target systems and a particular
goal---then reviews available information and undertakes various means
to attain the goal. A penetration test target may be a white box (which
provides background and system information) or black box (which provides
only basic or no information except the company name). A penetration
test can help determine whether a system is vulnerable to attack if the
defenses were sufficient, and which defenses (if any) the test defeated.</p>
<p>Security issues that the penetration test uncovers should be reported to
the system owner. Penetration test reports may also assess potential
impacts to the organization and suggest countermeasures to reduce risk.</p>
<p>The goals of a penetration test vary depending on the type of approved
activity for any given engagement with the primary goal focused on
finding vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a nefarious actor and
informing the client of those vulnerabilities along with recommended
mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Penetration tests are a component of a full security audit. For example,
the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requires penetration
testing on a regular schedule, and after system changes.</p>
<p>Flaw hypothesis methodology is a systems analysis and penetration
prediction technique where a list of hypothesized flaws in a software
system are compiled through analysis of the specifications and
documentation for the system. The list of hypothesized flaws is then
prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a flaw
actually exists, and on the ease of exploiting it to the extent of
control or compromise. The prioritized list is used to direct the actual
testing of the system.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="perl"><a class="header" href="#perl">Perl</a></h1>
<p>Perl is a family of two high-level, general-purpose, interpreted,
dynamic programming languages, Perl 5 and Perl 6.</p>
<p>Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms
in use, including &quot;Practical Extraction and Reporting Language&quot;. Perl
was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix
scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has
undergone many changes and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign
of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both
languages continue to be developed independently by different
development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another.</p>
<p>The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages
including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed; Wall also alludes to Basic
and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl (Schwartz &amp; Christiansen)
and so on. They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary
data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools,
facilitating manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread
popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to
its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.</p>

<p>Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based
on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.</p>
<p>Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution
model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the
sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other
paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such
as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by
the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and
grammar.</p>
<p>Common programming paradigms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>imperative which allows side effects,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>object-oriented which groups code together with the state the
code modifies,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>procedural which groups code into functions,</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>declarative which does not state the order in which operations
execute,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>functional which disallows side effects,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>logic which has a particular style of execution model coupled to
a particular style of syntax and grammar, and</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>symbolic programming which has a particular style of syntax and
grammar.</p>
<p>For example, languages that fall into the imperative paradigm have
two main features: they state the order in which operations occur,
with constructs that explicitly control that order, and they allow
side effects, in which state can be modified at one point in time,
within one unit of code, and then later read at a different point in
time inside a different unit of code. The communication between the
units of code is not explicit. Meanwhile, in object-oriented
programming, code is organized into objects that contain state that
is only modified by the code that is part of the object. Most
object-oriented languages are also imperative languages. In
contrast, languages that fit the declarative paradigm do not state
the order in which to execute operations. Instead, they supply a
number of operations that are available in the system, along with
the conditions under which each is allowed to execute. The
implementation of the language's execution model tracks which
operations are free to execute and chooses the order on its own.

<p>Python is an interpreted high-level programming
language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum
and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that
emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It
provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and
large scales. In July 2018, the creator Van Rossum stepped down as the
leader in the language community after 30 years.</p>
<p>Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive
standard library</p>
<p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 and had many
major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and
support for Unicode. With this release, the development process became
more transparent and community-backed.</p>
<p>Python 3.0 (initially called Python 3000 or py3k) was released on 3
December 2008 after a long testing period. It is a major revision of the
language that is not completely backward-compatible with previous
versions. However, many of its major features have been backported to
the Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series, and releases of Python 3
include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2
code to Python 3</p>

<p>A packet analyzer (also known as a packet sniffer) is a computer program
or piece of computer hardware (such as a packet capture appliance) that
can intercept and log traffic that passes over a digital network or part
of a network. Packet capture is the process of intercepting and logging
traffic. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures
each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the
values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content
according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.</p>
<p>A packet analyzer used for intercepting traffic on wireless networks is
known as a wireless analyzer or WiFi analyzer. A packet analyzer can
also be referred to as a network analyzer or protocol analyzer though
these terms also have other meanings.</p>
<p>Capabilities<br />
On wired shared medias networks, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI
networks, depending on the network structure (hub or switch), it may be
possible to capture all traffic on the network from a single machine on
the network. On modern networks, traffic can be captured using a network
switch with a so-called monitoring port that mirrors all packets that
pass through designated ports of the switch. A network tap is an even
more reliable solution than to use a monitoring port, since taps are
less likely to drop packets during high traffic load.</p>
<p>On wireless LANs, traffic can be captured on one channel at a time, or
by using multiple adapters, on several channels simultaneously.</p>
<p>On wired broadcast and wireless LANs, to capture unicast traffic between
other machines, the network adapter capturing the traffic must be in
promiscuous mode. On wireless LANs, even if the adapter is in
promiscuous mode, packets not for the service set the adapter is
configured for are usually ignored. To see those packets, the adapter
must be in monitor mode. No special provisions are required to capture
multicast traffic to a multicast group the packet analyzer is already
monitoring, or broadcast traffic.</p>
<p>When traffic is captured, either the entire contents of packets are
recorded, or just the headers are recorded. Recording just headers
reduces storage requirements, and avoids some legal issues, yet often
provides sufficient information to diagnose problems.</p>
<p>Captured information is decoded from raw digital form into a
human-readable format that lets users easily review exchanged
information. Protocol analyzers vary in their abilities to display and
analyze data.</p>
<p>Some protocol analyzers can also generate traffic and thus act as the
reference device. These can act as protocol testers. Such testers
generate protocol-correct traffic for functional testing, and may also
have the ability to deliberately introduce errors to test the DUT's
ability to handle errors.</p>
<p>Protocol analyzers can also be hardware-based, either in probe format
or, as is increasingly common, combined with a disk array. These devices
record packets (or a slice of the packet) to a disk array. This allows
historical forensic analysis of packets without users having to recreate
any fault.</p>

<p>ITU-T Recommendation Q.931 is the ITU standard ISDN connection control
signalling protocol, forming part of Digital Subscriber Signalling
System No. 1. Unlike connectionless systems like UDP, ISDN is connection
oriented and uses explicit signalling to manage call state: Q.931. Q.931
typically does not carry user data. Q.931 does not have a direct
equivalent in the Internet Protocol stack, but can be compared to SIP.
Q.931 does not provide flow control or perform retransmission, since the
underlying layers are assumed to be reliable and the circuit-oriented
nature of ISDN allocates bandwidth in fixed increments of 64 kbit/s.
Amongst other things, Q.931 manages connection setup and breakdown. Like
TCP, Q.931 documents both the protocol itself and a protocol state
machine.</p>
<p>Q.931 was designed for ISDN call establishment, maintenance, and release
of network connections between two DTEs on the ISDN D channel. Q.931 has
more recently been used as part of the VoIP H.323 protocol stack (see
H.225.0) and in modified form in some mobile phone transmission systems
and in ATM.</p>
<p>A Q.931 frame contains the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protocol discriminator (PD) -- Specifies which signaling protocol is
used for the connection (e.g. PD=8 for DSS1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call reference value (CR) -- Addresses different connections which
can exist simultaneously. The value is valid only during the actual
time period of the connection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message type (MT) -- Specifies the type of a layer 3 message out of
the Q.931-defined Message type set for call control (e.g. SETUP).
There are messages defined for the call setup, the call release and
the control of call features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information elements (IE) -- Specify further information which is
associated to the actual message. An IE contains the IE name
(e.g. bearer capability), their length and a variable field of
contents.</p>

<p>Quadrature Amplitude Modulation</p>
<p>Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is the name of a family of digital
modulation methods and a related family of analog modulation methods
widely used in modern telecommunications to transmit information. It
conveys two analog message signals, or two digital bit streams, by
changing (modulating) the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the
amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or amplitude
modulation (AM) analog modulation scheme. The two carrier waves of the
same frequency are out of phase with each other by 90°, a condition
known as orthogonality or quadrature. The transmitted signal is created
by adding the two carrier waves together. At the receiver, the two waves
can be coherently separated (demodulated) because of their orthogonality
property. Another key property is that the modulations are
low-frequency/low-bandwidth waveforms compared to the carrier frequency,
which is known as the narrowband assumption.</p>
<p>Phase modulation (analog PM) and phase-shift keying (digital PSK) can be
regarded as a special case of QAM, where the amplitude of the
transmitted signal is a constant, but its phase varies. This can also be
extended to frequency modulation (FM) and frequency-shift keying (FSK),
for these can be regarded as a special case of phase modulation.</p>
<p>QAM is used extensively as a modulation scheme for digital
telecommunication systems, such as in 802.11 Wi-Fi standards.
Arbitrarily high spectral efficiencies can be achieved with QAM by
setting a suitable constellation size, limited only by the noise level
and linearity of the communications channel.  QAM is being used in
optical fiber systems as bit rates increase; QAM16 and QAM64 can be
optically emulated with a 3-path interferometer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="qsig"><a class="header" href="#qsig">QSIG</a></h1>
<p>QSIG is an ISDN based signaling protocol for signaling between private
branch exchanges (PBXs) in a private integrated services network (PISN).
It makes use of the connection-level Q.931 protocol and the
application-level ROSE protocol. ISDN &quot;proper&quot; functions as the physical
link layer.</p>
<p>QSIG was originally developed by Ecma International, adopted by ETSI and
is defined by a set of ISO standard documents, so is not owned by any
company. This allows interoperability between communications platforms
provided by disparate vendors.</p>
<p>QSIG has two layers, called BC (basic call) and GF (generic function).
QSIG BC describes how to set up calls between PBXs. QSIG GF provides
supplementary services for large-scale corporate, educational, and
government networks, such as line identification, call intrusion and
call forwarding. Thus for a large or very distributed company that
requires multiple PBXs, users can receive the same services across the
network and be unaware of the switch that their telephone is connected
to. This greatly eases the problems of management of large networks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="qos"><a class="header" href="#qos">QoS</a></h1>
<p>Quality of Service</p>
<p>Quality of service (QoS) is the description or measurement of the
overall performance of a service, such as a telephony or computer
network or a cloud computing service, particularly the performance seen
by the users of the network. To quantitatively measure quality of
service, several related aspects of the network service are often
considered, such as packet loss, bit rate, throughput, transmission
delay, availability, jitter, etc.</p>
<p>In the field of computer networking and other packet-switched
telecommunication networks, quality of service refers to traffic
prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than
the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to
provide different priority to different applications, users, or data
flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow.</p>
<p>Quality of service is particularly important for the transport of
traffic with special requirements. In particular, developers have
introduced Voice over IP technology to allow computer networks to become
as useful as telephone networks for audio conversations, as well as
supporting new applications with even stricter network performance
requirements.</p>

<p>Radio Access Network Application Part</p>
<p>In telecommunications networks, RANAP (an acronym for Radio Access
Network Application Part) is a protocol specified by 3GPP in TS 25.413
and used in UMTS for signaling between the Core Network, which can be a
MSC or SGSN, and the UTRAN. RANAP is carried over Iu-interface.</p>
<p>RANAP signalling protocol resides in the control plane of Radio network
layer of Iu interface in the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication
System) protocol stack. Iu interface is the interface between RNC (Radio
Network Controller) and CN (Core Network). nb. For Iu-ps transport RANAP
is carried on SCTP if IP interface used on this.</p>
<p>RANAP handles signaling for the Iu-PS - RNC and 3G SGSN and Iu-CS - RNC
and 3G MSC . It also provides the signaling channel to transparently
pass messages between the User Equipment (UE) and the CN.</p>

<p>radio access network</p>
<p>A radio access network (RAN) is part of a mobile telecommunication
system. It implements a radio access technology. Conceptually, it
resides between a device such as a mobile phone, a computer, or any
remotely controlled machine and provides connection with its core
network (CN). Depending on the standard, mobile phones and other
wireless connected devices are varyingly known as user equipment (UE),
terminal equipment, mobile station (MS), etc. RAN functionality is
typically provided by a silicon chip residing in both the core network
as well as the user equipment.</p>
<p>Examples of radio access network types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GRAN: GSM radio access network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GERAN: essentially the same as GRAN but specifying the inclusion of
EDGE packet radio services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTRAN: UMTS radio access network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E-UTRAN: The Long Term Evolution (LTE) high speed and low latency
radio access network</p>
<p>It is also possible for a single handset/phone to be simultaneously
connected to multiple radio access networks. Handsets capable of
this are sometimes called dual-mode handsets. For instance it is
common for handsets to support both GSM and UMTS (a.k.a. &quot;3G&quot;) radio
access technologies. Such devices seamlessly transfer an ongoing
call between different radio access networks without the user
noticing any disruption in service.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rarp"><a class="header" href="#rarp">RARP</a></h1>
<p>Dynamic IP Address Allocation -- Reverse Address Resolution protocol</p>
<p>The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is an obsolete computer
networking protocol used by a client computer to request its Internet
Protocol (IPv4) address from a computer network, when all it has
available is its link layer or hardware address, such as a MAC address.
The client broadcasts the request and does not need prior knowledge of
the network topology or the identities of servers capable of fulfilling
its request.</p>
<p>RARP is described in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) publication
RFC 903. It has been rendered obsolete by the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
and the modern Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which both
support a much greater feature set than RARP.</p>
<p>RARP requires one or more server hosts to maintain a database of
mappings of Link Layer addresses to their respective protocol addresses.
Media Access Control (MAC) addresses need to be individually configured
on the servers by an administrator. RARP is limited to serving only IP
addresses.</p>
<p>Reverse ARP differs from the Inverse Address Resolution Protocol (InARP)
described in RFC 2390, which is designed to obtain the IP address
associated with a local Frame Relay data link connection identifier.
InARP is not used in Ethernet.</p>
<p>Modern Day Uses<br />
Although the original uses for RARP have been overcome by different
protocols, some modern day protocols use RARP. Examples are:</p>
<p>Cisco's Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV). RARP is used to update
the layer 2 forwarding tables when a MAC address moves between data
centers.</p>

<p>relational database management system</p>
<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management
system (DBMS) based on the relational model invented by Edgar F. Codd at
IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. Most databases in widespread use
today are based on his relational database model.</p>
<p>RDBMSs have been a common choice for the storage of information in
databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical
information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s.
Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases
and network databases because they were easier to implement and
administer. Nonetheless, relational databases received continued,
unsuccessful challenges by object database management systems in the
1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the
so-called object-relational impedance mismatch between relational
databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by XML
database management systems in the 1990s. However, due to the expanse of
technologies, such as horizontal scaling of computer clusters, NoSQL
databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS
databases<br />

<p>Representational State Transfer</p>
<p>Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that
defines a set of constraints and properties based on HTTP. Web Services
that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services,
provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.
REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and
manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform
and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of web services,
such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of
operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Web resources&quot; were first defined on the World Wide Web as documents or
files identified by their URLs. However, today they have a much more
generic and abstract definition that encompasses everything or entity
that can be identified, named, addressed, or handled, in any way
whatsoever, on the web. In a RESTful web service, requests made to a
resource's URI will elicit a response that may be in HTML, XML, JSON, or
some other format. The response may confirm that some alteration has
been made to the stored resource, and the response may provide hypertext
links to other related resources or collections of resources. When HTTP
is used, as is most common, the operations available are GET, POST, PUT,
DELETE, and other predefined CRUD HTTP methods.</p>
<p>By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, REST systems
aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow, by
re-using components that can be managed and updated without affecting
the system as a whole, even while it is running.</p>

<p>Routing Information Protocol</p>
<p>The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest
distance-vector routing protocols which employ the hop count as a
routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on
the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The
largest number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of
networks that RIP can support.</p>
<p>RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown
mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being
propagated.</p>
<p>In RIPv1 router broadcast updates with their routing table every 30
seconds. In the early deployments, routing tables were small enough that
the traffic was not significant. As networks grew in size, however, it
became evident there could be a massive traffic burst every 30 seconds,
even if the routers had been initialized at random times.</p>
<p>In most networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice for
routing as its time to converge and scalability are poor compared to
EIGRP, OSPF, or IS-IS. However, it is easy to configure, because RIP
does not require any parameters unlike other protocols.</p>
<p>RIP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport protocol, and
is assigned the reserved port number 520.</p>

<p>Radio Network Controller</p>
<p>The Radio Network Controller (or RNC) is a governing element in the UMTS
radio access network (UTRAN) and is responsible for controlling the Node
Bs that are connected to it. The RNC carries out radio resource
management, some of the mobility management functions and is the point
where encryption is done before user data is sent to and from the
mobile. The RNC connects to the Circuit Switched Core Network through
Media Gateway (MGW) and to the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) in the
Packet Switched Core Network.<br />
Interfaces</p>
<p>RNC Interfaces<br />
The logical connections between the network elements are known as
interfaces. The interface between the RNC and the Circuit Switched Core
Network (CS-CN) is called Iu-CS and between the RNC and the Packet
Switched Core Network is called Iu-PS. Other interfaces include Iub
(between the RNC and the Node B) and Iur (between RNCs in the same
network). Iu interfaces carry user traffic (such as voice or data) as
well as control information (see Protocols), and Iur interface is mainly
needed for soft handovers involving 2 RNCs though not required as the
absence of Iur will cause these handovers to become hard handovers.<br />
<img src="r/./images/15008901.png?width=480" alt="" /></p>
<p>Protocols<br />
Iub, Iu and Iur protocols all carry both user data and signalling (that
is, control plane).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Signalling protocol responsible for the control of the Node B by the
RNC is called NBAP (Node-B Application Part). NBAP is subdivided
into Common and Dedicated NBAP (C-NBAP and D-NBAP), where Common
NBAP controls overall Node B functionality and Dedicated NBAP
controls separate cells or sectors of the Node B. NBAP is carried
over Iub. In order for NBAP to handle common and dedicated
procedures, it is divided into: NodeB Control Port (NCP) which
handles common NBAP procedures and Communication Control Port (CCP)
which handles dedicated NBAP procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control plane protocol for the transport layer is called ALCAP

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rpc"><a class="header" href="#rpc">RPC</a></h1>
<p>In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a
computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a
different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared
network), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call,
without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote
interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code
whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote.
This is a form of client--server interaction (caller is client, executor
is server), typically implemented via a request--response
message-passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPC
calls are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model
implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures
is largely the same whether it is local or remote, but usually they are
not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls.
Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable
than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.</p>
<p>RPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different
processes have different address spaces: if on the same host machine,
they have distinct virtual address spaces, even though the physical
address space is the same; while if they are on different hosts, the
physical address space is different. Many different (often incompatible)
technologies have been used to implement the concept.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rrc"><a class="header" href="#rrc">RRC</a></h1>
<p>Radio Resource Control</p>
<p>The Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol is used in UMTS and LTE on the
Air interface. It is a layer that exists between UE and eNB and exists
at the IP level. This protocol is specified by 3GPP in TS 25.331 for
UMTS and in TS 36.331 for LTE. RRC messages are transported via the
PDCP-Protocol.</p>
<p>The major functions of the RRC protocol include connection establishment
and release functions, broadcast of system information, radio bearer
establishment, reconfiguration and release, RRC connection mobility
procedures, paging notification and release and outer loop power
control. By means of the signalling functions the RRC configures the
user and control planes according to the network status and allows for
Radio Resource Management strategies to be implemented.</p>
<p>The operation of the RRC is guided by a state machine which defines
certain specific states that a UE may be present in. The different
states in this state machine have different amounts of radio resources
associated with them and these are the resources that the UE may use
when it is present in a given specific state. Since different amounts of
resources are available at different states the quality of the service
that the user experiences and the energy consumption of the UE are
influenced by this state machine.</p>
<p>In order to comprehend the Radio Resource Control (RRC) state machine,
we should study the architecture of the third generation mobile cellular
system, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The UMTS
is composed by two subsystems, the UTRAN (Umts Terrestrial Radio Access
Network) and CN (core network) :<br />
<img src="r/./images/15008913.png?width=491" alt="" /></p>
<p>The RNC is responsible for the packet scheduling, radio resource control
and handover control.<br />
Unlike other wireless technologies like WIFI in which clients
concurrently send packets and collisions occur (and backoff algorithms),
in the UMTS there is a centralized entity that schedules resources to
each client. In order to manage the UE access to radio resources, the
UMTS introduces a radio resource control protocol (RRC) that attributes
each UE a specific state machine (based on radio resource usage). This
state machine is dependent on the 3G provider and can have different
states and/or transitions. According to the reference paper --
Characterizing Radio Resource Allocation for 3G Networks -- the studied
networks were composed by three states: IDLE, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH.<br />
In truth other states can actually be observed in some operators before
going into a disconnected mode. For example the PCH states -- URA_PCH
and CELL_PCH -- are states in which the user equipment has no transport
channels allocated but has to monitor the cell/UTRAN it is currently
connected to in order to send CELL_UPDATES to the RCN (just in case it
actually changes). This update implies temporarily changing the state to
a CELL_FACH in order to be able to send data. The change from
CELL_PCH, in which the UE is known at a cell level, to URA_PCH, in
which the user is known at UTRAN level, may be due to an increasing
number of CELL_UPDATES (e.g. travelling fast). This is useful in order
to speed up incoming connections since it might take around 0.9 seconds
to establish it against the 2.5s delay if the UE is on the IDLE state.<br />
Below is a diagram that represents the six most common states --
CELL_DCH, CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH, IDLE, DISCONNECT -- and some
of the possible transitions.<br />

<p>Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol</p>
<p>In 2001, the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) as
802.1w. RSTP provides significantly faster spanning tree convergence
after a topology change, introducing new convergence behaviors and
bridge port roles to do this. RSTP was designed to be
backwards-compatible with standard STP.</p>
<p>While STP can take 30 to 50 seconds to respond to a topology change,
RSTP is typically able to respond to changes within 3 × Hello times
(default: 3 times 2 seconds) or within a few milliseconds of a physical
link failure. The Hello time is an important and configurable time
interval that is used by RSTP for several purposes; its default value is
2 seconds.</p>
<p>Standard IEEE 802.1D-2004 incorporates RSTP and obsoletes the original
STP standard.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rsvp"><a class="header" href="#rsvp">RSVP</a></h1>
<p>Resource Reservation Protocol</p>
<p>The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is a transport layer protocol
designed to reserve resources across a network for quality of service
(QoS) using the integrated services model. RSVP operates over an IPv4 or
IPv6 and provides receiver-initiated setup of resource reservations for
multicast or unicast data flows. It does not transport application data
but is similar to a control protocol, like Internet Control Message
Protocol (ICMP) or Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). RSVP is
described in RFC 2205.</p>
<p>RSVP can be used by hosts and routers to request or deliver specific
levels of QoS for application data streams or flows. RSVP defines how
applications place reservations and how they can relinquish the reserved
resources once no longer required. RSVP operation will generally result
in resources being reserved in each node along a path. RSVP is not a
routing protocol and was designed to interoperate with current and
future routing protocols.</p>
<p>RSVP by itself is rarely deployed in telecommunications networks
today[citation needed] but, as of February 2003, the traffic
engineering extension of RSVP, or RSVP-TE, is becoming more widely
accepted nowadays in many QoS-oriented networks. Next Steps in Signaling
(NSIS) is a proposed replacement for RSVP.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rtcp"><a class="header" href="#rtcp">RTCP</a></h1>
<p>Real-Time Control Protocol</p>
<p>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is a sister protocol of the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP). Its basic functionality and packet structure
is defined in RFC 3550. RTCP provides out-of-band statistics and control
information for an RTP session. It partners with RTP in the delivery and
packaging of multimedia data, but does not transport any media data
itself.</p>
<p>The primary function of RTCP is to provide feedback on the quality of
service (QoS) in media distribution by periodically sending statistics
information such as transmitted octet and packet counts, packet loss,
packet delay variation, and round-trip delay time to participants in a
streaming multimedia session. An application may use this information to
control quality of service parameters, perhaps by limiting flow, or
using a different codec.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rtos"><a class="header" href="#rtos">RTOS</a></h1>
<p>A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS) intended
to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in,
typically without buffer delays. Processing time requirements (including
any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of
time. A real time system is a time bound system which has well defined
fixed time constraints. Processing must be done within the defined
constraints or the system will fail. They either are event driven or
time sharing. Event driven systems switch between tasks based on their
priorities while time sharing systems switch the task based on clock
interrupts. Most RTOS's use a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.</p>
<p>A key characteristic of an RTOS is the level of its consistency
concerning the amount of time it takes to accept and complete an
application's task; the variability is jitter. A hard real-time
operating system has less jitter than a soft real-time operating system.
The chief design goal is not high throughput, but rather a guarantee of
a soft or hard performance category. An RTOS that can usually or
generally meet a deadline is a soft real-time OS, but if it can meet a
deadline deterministically it is a hard real-time OS.</p>
<p>An RTOS has an advanced algorithm for scheduling. Scheduler flexibility
enables a wider, computer-system orchestration of process priorities,
but a real-time OS is more frequently dedicated to a narrow set of
applications. Key factors in a real-time OS are minimal interrupt
latency and minimal thread switching latency; a real-time OS is valued
more for how quickly or how predictably it can respond than for the
amount of work it can perform in a given period of time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rtp"><a class="header" href="#rtp">RTP</a></h1>
<p>Real-time Protocol</p>
<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a network protocol for
delivering audio and video over IP networks. RTP is used extensively in
communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media,
such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC,
television services and web-based push-to-talk features.</p>
<p>RTP typically runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). RTP is used in
conjunction with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). While RTP carries the
media streams (e.g., audio and video), RTCP is used to monitor
transmission statistics and quality of service (QoS) and aids
synchronization of multiple streams. RTP is one of the technical
foundations of Voice over IP and in this context is often used in
conjunction with a signalling protocol such as the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) which establishes connections across the network.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rtsp"><a class="header" href="#rtsp">RTSP</a></h1>
<p>Real Time Streaming Protocol</p>
<p>The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol
designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control
streaming media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and
controlling media sessions between end points. Clients of media servers
issue VCR-style commands, such as play, record and pause, to facilitate
real-time control of the media streaming from the server to a client
(Video On Demand) or from a client to the server (Voice Recording).</p>
<p>The transmission of streaming data itself is not a task of RTSP. Most
RTSP servers use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in conjunction
with Real-time Control Protocol (RTCP) for media stream delivery.</p>

<p>A risk-reward analysis is a very simple tool which can help you assess
the risk and reward profile of completely different options. It works in
the same way as a risk-return analysis which you may already be familiar
with.<br />
It can be applied at any level, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>by a CEO for comparing different strategic directions for the
company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by a program manager deciding which projects to keep within the
program and which to discard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by a project manager deciding how to sequence tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or simply by an individual team member deciding how best to spend
their day.</p>
<p>The template works by having risk plotted along one axis and reward
along the other. In the diagram below I've divided the template into
four sections to show you how to interpret the information.</p>
<p><img src="r/./images/15008883.png?width=215" alt="" /><br />
The four categories from the diagram above are as follows:</p>
<p>Equal Low: where risk and reward are both proportional and low.<br />
Equal High: where risk and reward are both proportional and high.<br />
Positive: represents a positive risk-reward balance, where a higher
return can be achieved with limited risk.<br />
Negative: represents a negative risk-reward balance, where a low
return is the reward for taking on a relatively high risk.<br />
How to Use it<br />
First, you need to create a list of all the different options and
their possible rewards. This can done quickly and roughly, or can
involve serious effort (market research, scenario development etc)
-- the effort you put in will depend on the size of the decision you
are making. Examples of some options might include: outsourcing
non-core activities, stop investing in poorly performing product
lines, invest in new products, or investing to move into new
markets. Once you have all the options and their potential reward,
they should be plotted on the risk-reward chart:<br />
<img src="r/./images/15008889.png?width=262" alt="" /><br />
At this stage some options will appear to have a more favourable
risk-reward profile than others, such as outsourcing in the above
example, but it is work taking the time to investigate whether any
options can have their risks mitigated, or if there are options that
can have their rewards boosted, before making a final decision on
which option to go with. In the above example, if the risk of
developing new products could be mitigated somehow then that option
would become more favourable than outsourcing.</p>
<p>Finally, for an even more complete picture to further aid our
decision making, we can add resources to the risk-reward template.
In the diagram below, the bigger the bubble the more resources are
required to execute that option.<br />
<img src="r/./images/15008895.png?width=267" alt="" /><br />
With risk, reward, and resources all plotted, we are able to trade
them against one another to find the best option for us. From the
diagram above you can see that outsourcing is probably the most
favourable option, providing plenty of upside reward but requiring
minimal resource and having little risk. Additionally, with so few
resources engaged in making the outsourcing happen, perhaps some
investigative work can start on the new product development option
with some of the spare resource.</p>

<p>Round-robin (RR) is one of the algorithms employed by process and
network schedulers in computing. As the term is generally used, time
slices (also known as time quanta) are assigned to each process in equal
portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority
(also known as cyclic executive). Round-robin scheduling is simple, easy
to implement, and starvation-free. Round-robin scheduling can also be
applied to other scheduling problems, such as data packet scheduling in
computer networks. It is an operating system concept.</p>
<p>The name of the algorithm comes from the round-robin principle known
from other fields, where each person takes an equal share of something
in turn.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="router"><a class="header" href="#router">Router</a></h1>
<p>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between
computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on
the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or
email, is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded
from one router to another router through the networks that constitute
an internetwork until it reaches its destination node.</p>
<p>A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks.
When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the
network address information in the packet to determine the ultimate
destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing
policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.</p>
<p>The most familiar type of routers are home and small office routers that
simply forward IP packets between the home computers and the Internet.
An example of a router would be the owner's cable or DSL router, which
connects to the Internet through an Internet service provider (ISP).
More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, connect large
business or ISP networks up to the powerful core routers that forward
data at high speed along the optical fiber lines of the Internet
backbone. Though routers are typically dedicated hardware devices,
software-based routers also exist</p>

<p>Single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) is a frequency-division multiple access

can be interpreted as a linearly precoded OFDMA scheme, in the sense
that it has an additional DFT processing step preceding the conventional
OFDMA processing.<br />
SC-FDMA has drawn great attention as an attractive alternative to OFDMA,
especially in the uplink communications where lower peak-to-average
power ratio (PAPR) greatly benefits the mobile terminal in terms of
transmit power efficiency and reduced cost of the power amplifier. It
has been adopted as the uplink multiple access scheme in 3GPP Long Term

<p>Synchronous Digital Hierarchy</p>
<p>Synchronous optical networking (SONET) and synchronous digital hierarchy
(SDH) are standardized protocols that transfer multiple digital bit
streams synchronously over optical fiber using lasers or highly coherent
light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs). At low transmission rates data
can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The method was
developed to replace the plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) system
for transporting large amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over
the same fiber without synchronization problems.</p>
<p>SONET and SDH, which are essentially the same, were originally designed
to transport circuit mode communications (e.g., DS1, DS3) from a variety
of different sources, but they were primarily designed to support
real-time, uncompressed, circuit-switched voice encoded in PCM
format.[1] The primary difficulty in doing this prior to SONET/SDH was
that the synchronization sources of these various circuits were
different. This meant that each circuit was actually operating at a
slightly different rate and with different phase. SONET/SDH allowed for
the simultaneous transport of many different circuits of differing
origin within a single framing protocol. SONET/SDH is not a
communications protocol in itself, but a transport protocol.</p>
<p>Due to SONET/SDH's essential protocol neutrality and transport-oriented
features, SONET/SDH was the obvious choice for transporting the fixed
length Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames also known as cells. It
quickly evolved mapping structures and concatenated payload containers
to transport ATM connections. In other words, for ATM (and eventually
other protocols such as Ethernet), the internal complex structure
previously used to transport circuit-oriented connections was removed
and replaced with a large and concatenated frame (such as STS-3c) into
which ATM cells, IP packets, or Ethernet frames are placed.</p>

<p>Space-division multiple access</p>
<p>Space-division multiple access (SDMA) is a channel access method based
on creating parallel spatial pipes[clarification needed] next to
higher capacity pipes through spatial multiplexing and/or diversity, by
which it is able to offer superior performance in radio multiple access
communication systems.[clarification needed] In traditional mobile
cellular network systems, the base station has no information on the
position of the mobile units within the cell and radiates the signal in
all directions within the cell in order to provide radio coverage. This
results in wasting power on transmissions when there are no mobile units
to reach, in addition to causing interference for adjacent cells using
the same frequency, so called co-channel cells. Likewise, in reception,
the antenna receives signals coming from all directions including noise
and interference signals. By using smart antenna technology and
differing spatial locations of mobile units within the cell,
space-division multiple access techniques offer attractive performance
enhancements. The radiation pattern of the base station, both in
transmission and reception, is adapted to each user to obtain highest
gain in the direction of that user. This is often done using phased
array techniques.</p>
<p>In GSM cellular networks, the base station is aware of the distance (but
not direction) of a mobile phone by use of a technique called &quot;timing
advance&quot; (TA). The base transceiver station (BTS) can determine how far
the mobile station (MS) is by interpreting the reported TA. This
information, along with other parameters, can then be used to power down
the BTS or MS, if a power control feature is implemented in the network.
The power control in either BTS or MS is implemented in most modern
networks, especially on the MS, as this ensures a better battery life
for the MS. This is also why having a BTS close to the user results in
less exposure to electromagnetic radiation.</p>

that the static architecture of traditional networks is decentralized

troubleshooting. SDN suggests to centralize network intelligence in one
network component by disassociating the forwarding process of network
packets (data plane) from the routing process (control plane). The
control plane consists of one or more controllers which are considered
as the brain of SDN network where the whole intelligence is
incorporated. However, the intelligence centralization has its own
drawbacks when it comes to security, scalability and elasticity and this

</li>
<li>
<p>SHA-2: A family of two similar hash functions, with different block
sizes, known as SHA-256 and SHA-512. They differ in the word size;
SHA-256 uses 32-bit words where SHA-512 uses 64-bit words. There are

<p>Subscriber Identity Module</p>
<p>A subscriber identity module or subscriber identification module (SIM),
widely known as a SIM card, is an integrated circuit that is intended to
securely store the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI)
number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate
subscribers on mobile telephony devices (such as mobile phones and
computers). It is also possible to store contact information on many SIM
cards. SIM cards are always used on GSM phones; for CDMA phones, they
are only needed for newer LTE-capable handsets. SIM cards can also be
used in satellite phones, smart watches, computers, or cameras.</p>
<p>The SIM circuit is part of the function of a universal integrated
circuit card (UICC) physical smart card, which is usually made of PVC
with embedded contacts and semiconductors. SIM cards are transferable
between different mobile devices. The first UICC smart cards were the
size of credit and bank cards; sizes were reduced several times over the
years, usually keeping electrical contacts the same, so that a larger
card could be cut down to a smaller size.</p>
<p>A SIM card contains its unique serial number (ICCID), international
mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, security authentication and
ciphering information, temporary information related to the local
network, a list of the services the user has access to, and two
passwords: a personal identification number (PIN) for ordinary use, and
a personal unblocking code (PUC) for PIN unlocking.</p>
<p>SIM cards have been made smaller over the years; functionality is
independent of format. Full-size SIM were followed by mini-SIM,
micro-SIM, and nano-SIM. SIM cards are also made to embed in devices.</p>

<p>Session Initiation Protocol</p>
<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a communications protocol for
signaling and controlling multimedia communication sessions in
applications of Internet telephony for voice and video calls, in private
IP telephone systems, as well as in instant messaging over Internet
Protocol (IP) networks.</p>
<p>The protocol defines the specific format of messages exchanged and the
sequence of communications for cooperation of the participants. SIP is a
text-based protocol, incorporating many elements of the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP).[1] A call established with SIP may consist of multiple media
streams, but no separate streams are required for applications, such as
text messaging, that exchange data as payload in the SIP message.</p>
<p>SIP works in conjunction with several other protocols that specify and
carry the session media. Media type and parameter negotiation and media
setup is performed with the Session Description Protocol (SDP), which is
carried as payload in SIP messages. SIP is designed to be independent of
the underlying transport layer protocol, and can be used with the User
Datagram Protocol (UDP), the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and
the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). For the transmission of
media streams (voice, video) SIP typically employs the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) or the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
(SRTP). For secure transmissions of SIP messages over insecure network
links, the protocol may be encrypted with Transport Layer Security
(TLS)<br />

<p>Subject Matter Expert</p>
<p>A subject-matter expert (SME) or domain expert is a person who is an
authority in a particular area or topic. The term domain expert is
frequently used in expert systems software development, and there the
term always refers to the domain other than the software domain. A
domain expert is a person with special knowledge or skills in a
particular area of endeavour (e.g. an accountant is an expert in the
domain of accountancy). The development of accounting software requires
knowledge in two different domains: accounting and software. Some of the
development workers may be experts in one domain and not the other.</p>

<p>Symmetric Multiprocessing</p>
<p>Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) involves a multiprocessor computer
hardware and software architecture where two or more identical
processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full
access to all input and output devices, and are controlled by a single
operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving
none for special purposes. Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP
architecture. In the case of multi-core processors, the SMP architecture
applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors.</p>
<p>Professor John D. Kubiatowicz considers traditionally SMP systems to
contain processors without caches. Culler and Pal-Singh in their 1998
book &quot;Parallel Computer Architecture: A Hardware/Software Approach&quot;
mention: &quot;The term SMP is widely used but causes a bit of confusion.
[...] The more precise description of what is intended by SMP is a
shared memory multiprocessor where the cost of accessing a memory
location is the same for all processors; that is, it has uniform access
costs when the access actually is to memory. If the location is cached,
the access will be faster. but cache access times and memory access
times are the same on all processors.&quot;</p>
<p>SMP systems are tightly coupled multiprocessor systems with a pool of
homogeneous processors running independently of each other. Each
processor, executing different programs and working on different sets of
data, has the capability of sharing common resources (memory, I/O
device, interrupt system and so on) that are connected using a system
bus or a crossbar.</p>

<p>Simple Network Management Protocol</p>
<p>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard
protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices
on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device
behavior. Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems,
routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and more.</p>
<p>SNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring. SNMP
exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems
organized in a management information base (MIB) which describe the
system status and configuration. These variables can then be remotely
queried (and, in some circumstances, manipulated) by managing
applications.</p>
<p>Three significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed.
SNMPv1 is the original version of the protocol. More recent versions,
SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, feature improvements in performance, flexibility and
security.</p>
<p>SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It consists of a set of
standards for network management, including an application layer
protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.</p>

<p>Simple Object Access Protocol</p>
<p>SOAP (originally Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol
specification for exchanging structured information in the

induce extensibility, neutrality and independence. It uses XML
Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer
protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.</p>
<p>SOAP allows processes running on disparate operating systems (such as
Windows and Linux) to communicate using Extensible Markup Language
(XML). Since Web protocols like HTTP are installed and running on all
operating systems, SOAP allows clients to invoke web services and
receive responses independent of language and platforms.<br />

<p>Service-oriented architecture</p>
<p>Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where
services are provided to the other components by application components,
through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of
service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and
technologies. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be
accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as
retrieving a credit card statement online.</p>
<p>A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of
SOA:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It logically represents a business activity with a specified
outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is self-contained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a black box for its consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may consist of other underlying services.</p>
<p>Different services can be used in conjunction to provide the
functionality of a large software application, a principle SOA
shares with modular programming. Service-oriented architecture
integrates distributed, separately-maintained and -deployed software
components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that
facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network,
especially over an IP network.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sonet"><a class="header" href="#sonet">SONET</a></h1>
<p>Synchronous Optical Network</p>
<p>Synchronous optical networking (SONET) and synchronous digital hierarchy
(SDH) are standardized protocols that transfer multiple digital bit
streams synchronously over optical fiber using lasers or highly coherent
light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs). At low transmission rates data
can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The method was
developed to replace the plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) system
for transporting large amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over
the same fiber without synchronization problems.</p>
<p>SONET and SDH, which are essentially the same, were originally designed
to transport circuit mode communications (e.g., DS1, DS3) from a variety
of different sources, but they were primarily designed to support
real-time, uncompressed, circuit-switched voice encoded in PCM
format.[1] The primary difficulty in doing this prior to SONET/SDH was
that the synchronization sources of these various circuits were
different. This meant that each circuit was actually operating at a
slightly different rate and with different phase. SONET/SDH allowed for
the simultaneous transport of many different circuits of differing
origin within a single framing protocol. SONET/SDH is not a
communications protocol in itself, but a transport protocol.</p>
<p>Due to SONET/SDH's essential protocol neutrality and transport-oriented
features, SONET/SDH was the obvious choice for transporting the fixed
length Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames also known as cells. It
quickly evolved mapping structures and concatenated payload containers
to transport ATM connections. In other words, for ATM (and eventually
other protocols such as Ethernet), the internal complex structure
previously used to transport circuit-oriented connections was removed
and replaced with a large and concatenated frame (such as STS-3c) into
which ATM cells, IP packets, or Ethernet frames are placed.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sql"><a class="header" href="#sql">SQL</a></h1>
<p>SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and
designed for managing data held in a relational database management
system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream
management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling
structured data where there are relations between different
entities/variables of the data. SQL offers two main advantages over
older read/write APIs like ISAM or VSAM: first, it introduced the
concept of accessing many records with one single command; and second,
it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or
without an index.</p>
<p>Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus,
SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally
classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data
definition language (DDL), a data control language (DCL), and a data
manipulation language (DML). The scope of SQL includes data query, data
manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema
creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is
often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language
(4GL), it also includes procedural elements.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ss7"><a class="header" href="#ss7">SS7</a></h1>
<p>Signaling System 7</p>
<p>Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) is a set of telephony signaling protocols
developed in 1975, which is used to set up and tear down most of the
world's public switched telephone network (PSTN) telephone calls. It
also performs number translation, local number portability, prepaid
billing, Short Message Service (SMS), and other mass market services.</p>
<p>In North America it is often referred to as CCSS7, abbreviated for
Common Channel Signaling System 7. In the United Kingdom, it is called
C7 (CCITT number 7), number 7 and CCIS7 (Common Channel Interoffice
Signaling 7). In Germany, it is often called ZZK-7 (Zentraler
ZeichengabeKanal Nummer 7).</p>
<p>The only international SS7 protocol is defined by ITU-T's Q.700-series
recommendations in 1988.[1] Of the many national variants of the SS7
protocols, most are based on variants of the international protocol as
standardized by ANSI and ETSI. National variants with striking
characteristics are the Chinese and Japanese (TTC) national variants.</p>
<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined the SIGTRAN
protocol suite that impinaplements levels 2, 3, and 4 protocols
compatible with SS7. Sometimes also called Pseudo SS7, it is layered on
the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) transport mechanism.</p>
<p>SS7 protocol suite</p>
<p>The SS7 protocol stack may be partially mapped to the OSI Model of a
packetized digital protocol stack. OSI layers 1 to 3 are provided by the
Message Transfer Part (MTP) and the Signalling Connection Control Part
(SCCP) of the SS7 protocol (together referred to as the Network Service
Part (NSP)); for circuit related signaling, such as the BT IUP,
Telephone User Part (TUP), or the ISDN User Part (ISUP), the User Part
provides layer 7. Currently there are no protocol components that
provide OSI layers 4 through 6.[1] The Transaction Capabilities
Application Part (TCAP) is the primary SCCP User in the Core Network,
using SCCP in connectionless mode. SCCP in connection oriented mode
provides transport layer for air interface protocols such as BSSAP and
RANAP. TCAP provides transaction capabilities to its Users (TC-Users),
such as the Mobile Application Part, the Intelligent Network Application
Part and the CAMEL Application Part.[citation needed]</p>
<p><img src="s/./images/15009026.png?width=480" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Message Transfer Part (MTP) covers a portion of the functions of the
OSI network layer including: network interface, information transfer,
message handling and routing to the higher levels. Signaling Connection
Control Part (SCCP) is at functional Level 4. Together with MTP Level 3
it is called the Network Service Part (NSP). SCCP completes the
functions of the OSI network layer: end-to-end addressing and routing,
connectionless messages (UDTs), and management services for users of the
Network Service Part (NSP).[12] Telephone User Part (TUP) is a
link-by-link signaling system used to connect calls. ISUP is the key
user part, providing a circuit-based protocol to establish, maintain,
and end the connections for calls. Transaction Capabilities Application
Part (TCAP) is used to create database queries and invoke advanced
network functionality, or links to Intelligent Network Application Part
(INAP) for intelligent networks, or Mobile Application Part (MAP) for
mobile services.</p>

<p>Spanning Tree Protocol</p>
<p>The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a
loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks. The basic function of
STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results
from them. Spanning tree also allows a network design to include backup
links to provide fault tolerance if an active link fails.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, STP creates a spanning tree within a network of
connected layer-2 bridges, and disables those links that are not part of
the spanning tree, leaving a single active path between any two network
nodes. STP is based on an algorithm that was invented by Radia Perlman
while she was working for Digital Equipment Corporation.</p>
<p>In 2001, the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) as
802.1w. RSTP provides significantly faster recovery in response to
network changes or failures, introducing new convergence behaviors and
bridge port roles to do this. RSTP was designed to be
backwards-compatible with standard STP.</p>

<p>STUN is a tool used by other protocols, such as Interactive Connectivity

It provides a tool for hosts to discover the presence of a network
address translator, and to discover the mapped, usually public, Internet

protocol requires assistance from a third-party network server (STUN
server) located on the opposing (public) side of the NAT, usually the
public Internet.</p>
<p>Originally, STUN was an acronym for Simple Traversal of User Datagram

supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance,
higher-order types (but not higher-rank types), and anonymous types.
Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator

<p>General term for a plan that defines calendar timing, resources,
dependencies, and other details for <em>tasks</em> necessary to complete a
project or part of a project. CxOne defines two major classes of
schedules, <em>business schedules</em> and <em>detailed schedules</em>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="scheduler"><a class="header" href="#scheduler">Scheduler</a></h1>
<p>In computing, scheduling is the method by which work specified by some
means is assigned to resources that complete the work. The work may be
virtual computation elements such as threads, processes or data flows,
which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as processors,
network links or expansion cards.</p>
<p>A scheduler is what carries out the scheduling activity. Schedulers are
often implemented so they keep all computer resources busy (as in load
balancing), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively,
or to achieve a target quality of service. Scheduling is fundamental to
computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the execution model of a
computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have
computer multitasking with a single central processing unit (CPU).</p>
<p>A scheduler may aim at one or more of many goals, for example:
maximizing throughput (the total amount of work completed per time
unit); minimizing wait time (time from work becoming enabled until the
first point it begins execution on resources); minimizing latency or
response time (time from work becoming enabled until it is finished in
case of batch activity, or until the system responds and hands the first
output to the user in case of interactive activity); or maximizing
fairness (equal CPU time to each process, or more generally appropriate
times according to the priority and workload of each process). In
practice, these goals often conflict (e.g. throughput versus latency),
thus a scheduler will implement a suitable compromise. Preference is
measured by any one of the concerns mentioned above, depending upon the
user's needs and objectives.</p>
<p>In real-time environments, such as embedded systems for automatic
control in industry (for example robotics), the scheduler also must
ensure that processes can meet deadlines; this is crucial for keeping
the system stable. Scheduled tasks can also be distributed to remote
devices across a network and managed through an administrative back end.</p>

concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. Semaphore is
simply a variable. This variable is used to solve critical section
problems and to achieve process synchronization in the multi processing
environment.</p>
<p>A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example,
incremented or decremented, or toggled) depending on programmer-defined
conditions.</p>
<p>A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in the real-world systems
is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available,
coupled with operations to adjust that record safely (i.e. to avoid race
conditions) as units are required or become free, and, if necessary,
wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.</p>
<p>Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions;
however, their use is by no means a guarantee that a program is free
from these problems. Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count
are called counting semaphores, while semaphores which are restricted to
the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are
called binary semaphores and are used to implement locks.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="softswitch"><a class="header" href="#softswitch">Softswitch</a></h1>
<p>A softswitch (software switch) is a central device in a
telecommunications network which connects telephone calls from one phone
line to another, across a telecommunication network or the public
Internet, entirely by means of software running on a general-purpose
computer system. Most landline calls are routed by purpose-built
electronic hardware; however, soft switches using general purpose
servers and VoIP technology are becoming more popular.[1]</p>
<p>Many telecommunications networks now make use of combinations of
softswitches and more traditional purpose-built hardware.</p>
<p>Although the term softswitch technically refers to any such device, it
is more conventionally applied to a device that handles IP-to-IP phone
calls, while the phrase &quot;access server&quot; or &quot;media gateway&quot; is used to
refer to devices that either originate or terminate traditional &quot;land
line&quot; (hard wired) phone calls. In practice, such devices can often do
both. As a practical distinction, a Skype-to-Skype phone call is
entirely IP (internet) based, and so uses a softswitch somewhere in the
middle connecting the calling party with the called party. In contrast,
access servers might take a mobile call or a call originating from a
traditional phone line, convert it to IP traffic, then send it over the
internet to another such device, which terminates the call by reversing
the process and converting the Voice over IP call back to older circuit
switched digital systems using traditional digital ISDN / PSTN protocols
that transmit voice traffic using non-IP systems.</p>
<p>The Call Agent takes care of functions such as billing, call routing,
signaling, call services and the like, supplying the functional logic to
accomplish these telephony meta-tasks. A call agent may control several
different media gateways in geographically dispersed areas via a TCP/IP
link. It is also used to control the functions of media gateway, in
order to connect with media as well as other interfaces. This procedure
is utilized to keep the interfaces clear as crystal for receiving calls
from any phone lines.[2]</p>
<p>The softswitch generally resides in a building owned by the telephone
company called a telephone exchange (UK/IRL/AUS/NZ) or central office
(US/CAN). The central office or telephone exchange has high capacity
connections to carry calls to other offices owned by the
telecommunication company and to other telecommunication companies via
the PSTN.</p>
<p>Looking towards the end users from the switch, the softswitch may be
connected to several access devices via TCP/IP network. These access
devices can range from small and large Analog Telephone Adaptors (ATA)
which provide from one to hundreds of Telephone Pairs to an Integrated
Access Device (IAD), eMTA s (embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapters)
using MGCP/NCS protocol over cable (VoCable) or PBX which may provide
several hundred telephone connections</p>
<p>Note here that Analogue (ATA), PSTN telephone devices can only be
reached by a softswitch that has embedded SS7 or SIGTRAN cards, software
in terms of signalling AND Trunking Gateway for Voice traffic IP/TDM,
TDM/IP, TDM/TDM functions.</p>
<p>Typically the larger access devices will be located in a building owned
by the telecommunication company near to the customers they serve. Each
end user can be connected to the IAD by a simple pair of copper wires.</p>
<p>The medium-sized devices and PBXs are most commonly used by business
that locate them on their own premises, and single-line devices are
mostly found at private residences.</p>
<p>At the turn of the 21st century with IP Multimedia Subsystem (or IMS),
the Softswitch element is represented by the Media Gateway Controller
(MGC) element, and the term &quot;Softswitch&quot; is rarely used in the IMS
context. Rather, it is called an AGCF (Access Gateway Control Function).</p>

facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to
be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source
code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary
machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be
stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be
interpreted and thus immediately executed.</p>
<p>Most application software is distributed in a form that includes only
executable files. If the source code were included it would be useful to
a user, programmer or a system administrator, any of whom might wish to
study or modify the program.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="switch"><a class="header" href="#switch">Switch</a></h1>
<p>A network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, officially
MAC bridge) is a computer networking device that connects devices
together on a computer network by using packet switching to receive,
process, and forward data to the destination device.</p>
<p>A network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses hardware
addresses to process and forward data at the data link layer (layer 2)
of the OSI model. Some switches can also process data at the network
layer (layer 3) by additionally incorporating routing functionality.
Such switches are commonly known as layer-3 switches or multilayer
switches.</p>
<p>Switches for Ethernet are the most common form of network switch. The
first Ethernet switch was introduced by Kalpana in 1990. Switches also
exist for other types of networks including Fibre Channel, Asynchronous
Transfer Mode, and InfiniBand.</p>
<p>Unlike less advanced repeater hubs, which broadcast the same data out of
each of its ports and let the devices decide what data they need, a
network switch forwards data only to the devices that need to receive it</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="systemx"><a class="header" href="#systemx">SystemX</a></h1>
<p>2nd national digital telephone exchange system to be used in the United
Kingdom.</p>
<p>System X was developed by the UK Post Office (later to become British
Telecom), GEC, Plessey (later to be Marconi), and Standard Telephones
and Cables (STC).</p>
<p>System X covers three main types of telephone switching equipment. Many
of these switches reside all over the United Kingdom. Concentrators are
usually kept in local telephone exchanges but can be housed remotely in
less populated areas. DLEs and DMSUs operate in major towns and cities
and provide call routing functions.</p>
<p>Concentrator unit<br />
The concentrator unit consists of four main sub-systems, line modules,
digital concentrator switch, digital line termination (DLT) units and
control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to
digital format and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to
the digital local exchange (DLE). It also receives dialled information
from the subscriber and passes this to the DLE, so that the call can be
routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch
signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if
the connection to the DLE is lost.</p>
<p>Digital local exchange<br />
The Digital Local Exchange (DLE) connects to the concentrator and routes
calls to different DLEs or DMSUs depending on the destination of the
call. The heart of the DLE is the Digital Subscriber Switching Subsystem
(DSSS) which consists of Time Switches and a Space Switch. Incoming
traffic on the 30 channel PCM highways from the Concentrator Units is
connected to Time Switches. The purpose of these is to take any incoming
individual Time Slot and connect it to an outgoing Time Slot and so
perform a switching and routing function.</p>
<p>Digital main switching unit<br />
The Digital Main Switching Unit (DMSU) deals with calls that have been
routed by DLEs or another DMSU and is a 'trunk switch', i.e. it is not
connected to any concentrators. As with DLEs, DMSUs are made up of a
Digital Switching Subsystem and a Processor Utility Subsystem, amongst
other things. In the British PSTN network, each DMSU is connected to
every other DMSU in the country, enabling almost congestion-proof
connectivity for calls through the network.</p>
<p>Replacement system<br />
Many of the switches installed during the 1980s are near to or over 30
years old and still in use within local exchanges, giving an idea of
their reliability.</p>
<p>System X was scheduled for replacement with Next Generation softswitch
equipment as part of the BT 21st Century Network (21CN) programme. Some
other users of System X -- in particular Jersey Telecom and Kingston
Communications -- replaced their circuit switched System X equipment
with Marconi XCD5000 softswitches (which are the NGN replacement for
System X) and Access Hub multiservice access nodes. However, the
omission of Marconi from the BT 21CN supplier list, the lack of a
suitable replacement softswitch to match System X reliability, and the
shift in focus away from telephony onto broadband -- all led to much of
the System X estate being maintained.</p>

<p>Transaction Capabilities Application Part</p>
<p>Transaction Capabilities Application Part, from ITU-T recommendations
Q.771-Q.775 or ANSI T1.114 is a protocol for Signalling System 7
networks. Its primary purpose is to facilitate multiple concurrent
dialogs between the same sub-systems on the same machines, using
Transaction IDs to differentiate these, similar to the way TCP ports
facilitate multiplexing connections between the same IP addresses on the
Internet.</p>
<p>TCAP uses ASN.1 BER encoding, as well as the protocols it encapsulates,
namely MAP in mobile phone networks or INAP in Intelligent Networks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tcp"><a class="header" href="#tcp">TCP</a></h1>
<p>Transmission Control Protocol</p>
<p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of
the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network
implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP).
Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP
provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of
octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via
an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web,
email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP.
Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use
the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless
datagram service that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability.</p>

<p>Time Division Multiplexing</p>
<p>Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is a method of transmitting and
receiving independent signals over a common signal path by means of
synchronized switches at each end of the transmission line so that each
signal appears on the line only a fraction of time in an alternating
pattern. It is used when the bit rate of the transmission medium exceeds
that of the signal to be transmitted. This form of signal multiplexing
was developed in telecommunications for telegraphy systems in the late
19th century, but found its most common application in digital telephony
in the second half of the 20th century.<br />

<p>Temporal Key Integrity Protocol</p>
<p>Temporal Key Integrity Protocol or TKIP /tiːˈkɪp/ is a security protocol
used in the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard. TKIP was designed
by the IEEE 802.11i task group and the Wi-Fi Alliance as an interim
solution to replace WEP without requiring the replacement of legacy
hardware. This was necessary because the breaking of WEP had left Wi-Fi
networks without viable link-layer security, and a solution was required
for already deployed hardware. However, TKIP itself is no longer
considered secure, and was deprecated in the 2012 revision of the 802.11
standard.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tls"><a class="header" href="#tls">TLS</a></h1>
<p>Transport Layer Security</p>
<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) -- and its predecessor, Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL), which is now deprecated by the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) -- are cryptographic protocols that provide communications
security over a computer network. Several versions of the protocols find
widespread use in applications such as web browsing, email, instant
messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). Websites are able to use TLS to
secure all communications between their servers and web browsers.</p>
<p>The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity
between two or more communicating computer applications. When secured by
TLS, connections between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server
(e.g., wikipedia.org) have one or more of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The connection is private (or secure) because symmetric cryptography
is used to encrypt the data transmitted. The keys for this symmetric
encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based
on a shared secret negotiated at the start of the session. The
server and client negotiate the details of which encryption
algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of
data is transmitted . The negotiation of a shared secret is both
secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and
cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the
middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the
communications during the negotiation without being detected).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using
public-key cryptography. This authentication can be made optional,
but is generally required for at least one of the parties (typically
the server).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The connection is reliable because each message transmitted includes
a message integrity check using a message authentication code to
prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during
transmission.</p>

<p>Tk is a free and open-source, cross-platform widget toolkit that
provides a library of basic elements of GUI widgets for building a
graphical user interface (GUI) in many programming languages.</p>
<p>Tk provides a number of widgets commonly needed to develop desktop
applications, such as button, menu, canvas, text, frame, label, etc. Tk
has been ported to run on most flavors of Linux, Mac OS, Unix, and
Microsoft Windows. Like Tcl, Tk supports Unicode within the Basic
Multilingual Plane but it has not yet been extended to handle 32-bit
Unicode.</p>
<p>Tk was designed to be extended, and a wide range of extensions are
available that offer new widgets or other capabilities.</p>
<p>Since Tcl/Tk 8, it offers &quot;native look and feel&quot; (for instance, menus
and buttons are displayed in the manner of &quot;native&quot; software for any
given platform). Highlights of version 8.5 include a new theming engine,
originally called Tk Tile, but now generally referred to as &quot;themed Tk&quot;,
as well as improved font rendering.</p>

shells, functions cannot be defined in a tcsh script and the user must
use aliases instead (as in csh). It is the native root
shell for BSD-based systems such as FreeBSD.</p>
<p>tcsh added filename and command completion and command line editing
concepts borrowed from the Tenex system, which is the source of the &quot;t&quot;.
Because it only added functionality and did not change what was there,
tcsh remained backward compatible with the original C shell. Though it
started as a side branch from the original source tree Joy had created,
tcsh is now the main branch for ongoing development. tcsh is very stable
but new releases continue to appear roughly once a year, consisting
mostly of minor bug fixes.</p>

<p>Technical debt can be compared to monetary debt. If technical debt is
not repaid, it can accumulate 'interest', making it harder to implement
changes later on. Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy.
Technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes (e.g., as a
proof-of-concept) technical debt is required to move projects forward.
On the other hand, some experts claim that the &quot;technical debt&quot; metaphor
tends to minimize the impact, which results in insufficient

<p>User Agent</p>
<p>In computing, a user agent is software (a software agent) that is acting
on behalf of a user. One common use of the term refers to a web browser
telling a website information about the browser and operating system.
This allows the website to customize content for the capabilities of a
particular device, but also raises privacy issues.</p>
<p>There are other uses of the term &quot;user agent&quot;. For example, an email
reader is a mail user agent. In many cases, a user agent acts as a
client in a network protocol used in communications within a
client--server distributed computing system. In particular, the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) identifies the client software
originating the request, using a user-agent header, even when the client
is not operated by a user. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
protocol (based on HTTP) followed this usage. In the SIP, the term user
agent refers to both end points of a communications session.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="udp"><a class="header" href="#udp">UDP</a></h1>
<p>User Datagram Protocol</p>
<p>In computer networking, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the
core members of the Internet protocol suite. The protocol was designed
by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768. With UDP,
computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as
datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Prior
communications are not required in order to set up communication
channels or data paths.</p>
<p>UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of
protocol mechanism. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port
numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination
of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the
user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; There is
no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If
error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level,
an application may use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this
purpose.</p>
<p>UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are
either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the
overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive
applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to
waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an
option in a real-time system.<br />

<p>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental,
modeling language in the field of software engineering, that is intended
to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.</p>
<p>The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to
standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software
design. It was developed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson and James
Rumbaugh at Rational Software in 1994--1995, with further development
led by them through 1996.</p>
<p>In 1997 UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group
(OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005 UML
was also published by the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) as an approved ISO standard.[2] Since then the standard has been
periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML.</p>
<p>Design<br />
UML offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a
diagram, including elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>any activities (jobs);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>individual components of the system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and how they can interact with other software components;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how the system will run;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how entities interact with others (components and interfaces);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>external user interface.</p>
<p>Although originally intended for object-oriented design
documentation, UML has been extended to a larger set of design
documentation (as listed above),and been found useful in many
contexts.</p>

<p>Universal Mobile Telecommunications System</p>
<p>The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a third
generation mobile cellular system for networks based on the GSM
standard. Developed and maintained by the 3GPP (3rd Generation
Partnership Project), UMTS is a component of the International
Telecommunications Union IMT-2000 standard set and compares with the
CDMA2000 standard set for networks based on the competing cdmaOne
technology. UMTS uses wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA)
radio access technology to offer greater spectral efficiency and
bandwidth to mobile network operators.</p>
<p>UMTS specifies a complete network system, which includes the radio
access network (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network, or UTRAN), the
core network (Mobile Application Part, or MAP) and the authentication of
users via SIM (subscriber identity module) cards.</p>
<p>The technology described in UMTS is sometimes also referred to as

<p>URIs encompasses both URLs, URNs, and other ways to indicate a resource.</p>
<p>An example of a URI that is neither a URL nor a URN would be a data URI
such as data:,Hello%20World. It is not a URL or URN because the URI
contains the data. It neither names it, nor tells you how to locate it
over the network.</p>
<p>There are also uniform resource citations (URCs) that point to meta data
about a document rather than to the document itself. An example of a URC
would be an indicator for viewing the source code of a web page:
view-source:</p>
<p><a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a></p>
<p>. A URC is another type of URI that is neither URL nor URN.</p>

<p>Coordinated Universal Time or Universal Time Coordinated (abbreviated to
UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="utf-16"><a class="header" href="#utf-16">UTF-16</a></h1>
<p>UTF-32 stands for Unicode Transformation Format in 32 bits. It is a
protocol to encode Unicode code points that uses exactly 32 bits per
Unicode code point (but a number of leading bits must be zero as there
are fewer than 221 Unicode code points). UTF-32 is a fixed-length
encoding, in contrast to all other Unicode transformation formats, which
are variable-length encodings. Each 32-bit value in UTF-32 represents
one Unicode code point and is exactly equal to that code point's
numerical value.</p>
<p>The main advantage of UTF-32 is that the Unicode code points are
directly indexed. Finding the Nth code point in a sequence of code
points is a constant time operation. In contrast, a variable-length code
requires sequential access to find the Nth code point in a sequence.
This makes UTF-32 a simple replacement in code that uses integers that
are incremented by one to examine each location in a string, as was
commonly done for ASCII.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of UTF-32 is that it is space-inefficient, using
four bytes per code point. Characters beyond the BMP are relatively rare
in most texts, and can typically be ignored for sizing estimates. This
makes UTF-32 close to twice the size of UTF-16. It can be up to four
times the size of UTF-8 depending on how many of the characters are in
the ASCII subset.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="utf-8"><a class="header" href="#utf-8">UTF-8</a></h1>
<p>UTF-8 is a variable width character encoding capable of encoding all
1,112,064 valid code points in Unicode using one to four 8-bit bytes.
The encoding is defined by the Unicode standard, and was originally
designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. The name is derived from Unicode
(or Universal Coded Character Set) Transformation Format -- 8-bit.</p>
<p>It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII. Code points with
lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded
using fewer bytes. The first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond
one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single octet with the same
binary value as ASCII, so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8-encoded
Unicode as well. Since ASCII bytes do not occur when encoding non-ASCII
code points into UTF-8, UTF-8 is safe to use within most programming and
document languages that interpret certain ASCII characters in a special
way, such as &quot;/&quot; in filenames, &quot;&quot; in escape sequences, and&quot;%&quot; in
printf.</p>
<p>UTF-8 has been the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web
since 2009, as it is most popular in every country, and as of July 2018
accounts for 91.9% of all web pages and 95.5% of the top 1,000 highest
ranked web pages (some of which are simply ASCII, a subset of UTF-8).
The next-most popular multibyte encodings, Shift JIS and GB 2312, have
0.5% and 0.5% respectively. The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC)
recommended that all e-mail programs be able to display and create mail
using UTF-8,and the W3C recommends UTF-8 as the default encoding in XML
and HTML.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="utran"><a class="header" href="#utran">UTRAN</a></h1>
<p>Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network</p>
<p>UTRAN (short for &quot;Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network&quot;) is a
collective term for the network and equipment that connects mobile
handsets to the public telephone network or the Internet. It contains
the base stations, which are called Node B's and Radio Network
Controllers (RNCs) which make up the UMTS radio access network. This
communications network, commonly referred to as 3G (for 3rd Generation
Wireless Mobile Communication Technology), can carry many traffic types
from real-time Circuit Switched to IP based Packet Switched. The UTRAN
allows connectivity between the UE (user equipment) and the core
network.</p>
<p>The RNC provides control functionalities for one or more Node Bs. A Node
B and an RNC can be the same device, although typical implementations
have a separate RNC located in a central office serving multiple Node
Bs. Despite the fact that they do not have to be physically separated,
there is a logical interface between them known as the Iub. The RNC and
its corresponding Node Bs are called the Radio Network Subsystem (RNS).
There can be more than one RNS present in a UTRAN.</p>
<p>There are four interfaces connecting the UTRAN internally or externally
to other functional entities: Iu, Uu, Iub and Iur. The Iu interface is
an external interface that connects the RNC to the Core Network (CN).
The Uu is also external, connecting the Node B with the User Equipment
(UE). The Iub is an internal interface connecting the RNC with the Node
B. And at last there is the Iur interface which is an internal interface
most of the time, but can, exceptionally be an external interface too
for some network architectures. The Iur connects two RNCs with each
other.<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="unicode"><a class="header" href="#unicode">Unicode</a></h1>
<p>Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding,
representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's
writing systems. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium,
and as of June 2018 the most recent version, Unicode 11.0, contains a
repertoire of 137,439 characters covering 146 modern and historic
scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets and emoji. The character
repertoire of the Unicode Standard is synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646,
and both are code-for-code identical.</p>
<p>The Unicode Standard consists of a set of code charts for visual
reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a
set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as
character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation,
rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of
text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew,
and left-to-right scripts).</p>
<p>Unicode's success at unifying character sets has led to its widespread
and predominant use in the internationalization and localization of
computer software. The standard has been implemented in many recent
technologies, including modern operating systems, XML, Java (and other
programming languages), and the .NET Framework.</p>
<p>Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings. The Unicode
standard defines UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, and several other encodings
are in use. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and
UCS-2, a precursor of UTF-16.</p>
<p>UTF-8, dominantly used by websites (over 91%), uses one byte for the
first 128 code points, and up to 4 bytes for other characters. The first
128 Unicode code points are the ASCII characters, which means that any
ASCII text is also a UTF-8 text.</p>
<p>UCS-2 uses two bytes (16 bits) for each character but can only encode
the first 65,536 code points, the so-called Basic Multilingual Plane
(BMP). With 1,114,112 code points on 17 planes being possible, and with
over 137,000 code points defined so far, many Unicode characters are
beyond the reach of UCS-2. Therefore, UCS-2 is obsolete, though still
widely used in software. UTF-16 extends UCS-2, by using the same 16-bit
encoding as UCS-2 for the Basic Multilingual Plane, and a 4-byte
encoding for the other planes. As long as it contains no code points in
the reserved range U+D800--U+DFFF, a UCS-2 text is a valid UTF-16 text.</p>
<p>UTF-32 (also referred to as UCS-4) uses four bytes for each character.
Like UCS-2, the number of bytes per character is fixed, facilitating
character indexing; but unlike UCS-2, UTF-32 is able to encode all
Unicode code points. However, because each character uses four bytes,
UTF-32 takes significantly more space than other encodings, and is not
widely used.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="unified-communications"><a class="header" href="#unified-communications">Unified Communications</a></h1>
<p>Unified communications (UC) is a business and marketing concept
describing the integration of enterprise communication services such as
instant messaging (chat), presence information, voice (including IP
telephony), mobility features (including extension mobility and single
number reach), audio, web &amp; video conferencing, fixed-mobile convergence
(FMC), desktop sharing, data sharing (including web connected electronic
interactive whiteboards), call control and speech recognition with
non-real-time communication services such as unified messaging
(integrated voicemail, e-mail, SMS and fax). UC is not necessarily a
single product, but a set of products that provides a consistent unified
user interface and user experience across multiple devices and media
types.</p>
<p>In its broadest sense, the UC can encompass all forms of communications
that are exchanged via a network to include other forms of
communications such as Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and digital
signage Communications as they become an integrated part of the network
communications deployment and may be directed as one-to-one
communications or broadcast communications from one to many.</p>
<p>UC allows an individual to send a message on one medium and receive the
same communication on another medium. For example, one can receive a
voicemail message and choose to access it through e-mail or a cell
phone. If the sender is online according to the presence information and
currently accepts calls, the response can be sent immediately through
text chat or a video call. Otherwise, it may be sent as a non-real-time
message that can be accessed through a variety of media.</p>

Microsystems (Solaris). In the early 1990s, AT&amp;T sold its rights in Unix
to Novell, which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation

industry consortium, which allows the use of the mark for certified
operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).
As of 2014, the Unix version with the largest installed base is Apple's

<p>Voice Activity Detection</p>
<p>Voice activity detection (VAD), also known as speech activity detection
or speech detection, is a technique used in speech processing in which
the presence or absence of human speech is detected. The main uses of
VAD are in speech coding and speech recognition. It can facilitate
speech processing, and can also be used to deactivate some processes
during non-speech section of an audio session: it can avoid unnecessary
coding/transmission of silence packets in Voice over Internet Protocol
applications, saving on computation and on network bandwidth.</p>
<p>VAD is an important enabling technology for a variety of speech-based
applications. Therefore, various VAD algorithms have been developed that
provide varying features and compromises between latency, sensitivity,
accuracy and computational cost. Some VAD algorithms also provide
further analysis, for example whether the speech is voiced, unvoiced or
sustained. Voice activity detection is usually language independent.</p>

<p>VB Script</p>
<p>VBScript (&quot;Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition&quot;) is an Active
Scripting language developed by Microsoft that is modeled on Visual
Basic. It allows Microsoft Windows system administrators to generate
powerful tools for managing computers with error handling, subroutines,
and other advanced programming constructs. It can give the user complete
control over many aspects of their computing environment.</p>
<p>VBScript uses the Component Object Model to access elements of the
environment within which it is running; for example, the
FileSystemObject (FSO) is used to create, read, update and delete files.
VBScript has been installed by default in every desktop release of
Microsoft Windows since Windows 98; in Windows Server since Windows NT
4.0 Option Pack; and optionally with Windows CE (depending on the device
it is installed on).</p>

<p>Visual Basic</p>
<p>Visual Basic is a third-generation event-driven programming language and
integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft for its
Component Object Model (COM) programming model first released in 1991
and declared legacy during 2008. Microsoft intended Visual Basic to be
relatively easy to learn and use. Visual Basic was derived from BASIC
and enables the rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user
interface (GUI) applications, access to databases using Data Access
Objects, Remote Data Objects, or ActiveX Data Objects, and creation of
ActiveX controls and objects.</p>
<p>A programmer can create an application using the components provided by
the Visual Basic program itself. Over time the community of programmers
developed third-party components. Programs written in Visual Basic can
also use the Windows API, which requires external function declarations.</p>

<p>Virtual Channel Identifier</p>
<p>The VCI, used in conjunction with the VPI (virtual path indicator),
indicates where an ATM cell is to travel over a network. ATM, or
asynchronous transfer mode, is a method that many ISPs (Internet Service
Providers) use to transfer data to client computers. Because ATM sends
packets over fixed channels, the data is easier to track than
information sent over the standard TCP/IP protocol.</p>
<p>The VCI within each ATM cell defines the fixed channel on which the
packet of information should be sent. It is a 16-bit field, compared to
the VPI, which is only 8 bits. Since this numerical tag specifies the
virtual channel that each packet belongs to, it prevents interference
with other data being sent across the network.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vc"><a class="header" href="#vc">VC</a></h1>
<p>Virtual Circuit</p>
<p>A virtual circuit (VC) is a means of transporting data over a packet
switched computer network in such a way that it appears as though there
is a dedicated physical layer link between the source and destination
end systems of this data. The term virtual circuit is synonymous with
virtual connection and virtual channel. Before a connection or virtual
circuit may be used, it has to be established, between two or more nodes
or software applications, by configuring the relevant parts of the
interconnecting network. After that, a bit stream or byte stream may be
delivered between the nodes; hence, a virtual circuit protocol allows
higher level protocols to avoid dealing with the division of data into
segments, packets, or frames.</p>
<p>Virtual circuit communication resembles circuit switching, since both
are connection oriented, meaning that in both cases data is delivered in
correct order, and signalling overhead is required during a connection
establishment phase. However, circuit switching provides a constant bit
rate and latency, while these may vary in a virtual circuit service due
to factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>varying packet queue lengths in the network nodes,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>varying bit rate generated by the application,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>varying load from other users sharing the same network resources by
means of statistical multiplexing, etc.</p>
<p>Many virtual circuit protocols, but not all, provide reliable
communication service through the use of data retransmissions
because of error detection and automatic repeat request (ARQ).</p>
<p>An alternate network configuration to virtual circuit is datagram.</p>

<p>Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line</p>
<p>Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) and very-high-bit-rate
digital subscriber line 2 <a href="v/2">VDSL2</a> are digital subscriber line (DSL)
technologies providing data transmission faster than asymmetric digital
subscriber line (ADSL).</p>
<p>VDSL offers speeds of up to 52 Mbit/s downstream and 16 Mbit/s upstream,
over a single flat untwisted or twisted pair of copper wires using the
frequency band from 25 kHz to 12 MHz. These rates mean that VDSL is
capable of supporting applications such as high-definition television,
as well as telephone services (voice over IP) and general Internet
access, over a single connection. VDSL is deployed over existing wiring
used for analog telephone service and lower-speed DSL connections. This
standard was approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
in November 2001.</p>
<p>Second-generation systems (VDSL2; ITU-T G.993.2 approved in February
2006) use frequencies of up to 30 MHz to provide data rates exceeding
100 Mbit/s simultaneously in both the upstream and downstream
directions. The maximum available bit rate is achieved at a range of
about 300 meters; performance degrades as the local loop attenuation
increases.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vhdl"><a class="header" href="#vhdl">VHDL</a></h1>
<p>The VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is a hardware description
language (HDL) that can model the behavior and structure of digital
systems at multiple levels of abstraction, ranging from the system level
down to that of logic gates, for design entry, documentation, and
verification purposes. Since 1987, VHDL has been standardized by the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as IEEE Std
1076; the latest version (as of April 2020) of which is IEEE Std
1076-2019. To model analog and mixed-signal systems, an
IEEE-standardized HDL based on VHDL called VHDL-AMS (officially IEEE
1076.1) has been developed.</p>
<p>VHDL is named after the United States Department of Defense program that
created it, the Very High-Speed Integrated Circuits Program (VHSIC). In
the early 1980s, the VHSIC Program sought a new HDL for use in the
design of the integrated circuits it aimed to develop. The product of
this effort was VHDL Version 7.2, released in 1985. The effort to
standardize it as an IEEE standard began in the following year.</p>
<p>VHDL is generally used to write text models that describe a logic
circuit. Such a model is processed by a synthesis program, only if it is
part of the logic design. A simulation program is used to test the logic
design using simulation models to represent the logic circuits that
interface to the design. This collection of simulation models is
commonly called a testbench.</p>
<p>A VHDL simulator is typically an event-driven simulator. This means that
each transaction is added to an event queue for a specific scheduled
time. E.g. if a signal assignment should occur after 1 nanosecond, the
event is added to the queue for time +1ns. Zero delay is also allowed,
but still needs to be scheduled: for these cases delta delay is used,
which represent an infinitely small time step. The simulation alters
between two modes: statement execution, where triggered statements are
evaluated, and event processing, where events in the queue are
processed.</p>
<p>VHDL has constructs to handle the parallelism inherent in hardware
designs, but these constructs (processes) differ in syntax from the
parallel constructs in Ada (tasks). Like Ada, VHDL is strongly typed and
is not case sensitive. In order to directly represent operations which
are common in hardware, there are many features of VHDL which are not
found in Ada, such as an extended set of Boolean operators including
nand and nor.</p>
<p>VHDL has file input and output capabilities, and can be used as a
general-purpose language for text processing, but files are more
commonly used by a simulation testbench for stimulus or verification
data. There are some VHDL compilers which build executable binaries. In
this case, it might be possible to use VHDL to write a testbench to
verify the functionality of the design using files on the host computer
to define stimuli, to interact with the user, and to compare results
with those expected. However, most designers leave this job to the
simulator.</p>
<p>It is relatively easy for an inexperienced developer to produce code
that simulates successfully but that cannot be synthesized into a real
device, or is too large to be practical. One particular pitfall is the
accidental production of transparent latches rather than D-type
flip-flops as storage elements.</p>
<p>One can design hardware in a VHDL IDE (for FPGA implementation such as
Xilinx ISE, Altera Quartus, Synopsys Synplify or Mentor Graphics HDL
Designer) to produce the RTL schematic of the desired circuit. After
that, the generated schematic can be verified using simulation software
which shows the waveforms of inputs and outputs of the circuit after
generating the appropriate testbench. To generate an appropriate
testbench for a particular circuit or VHDL code, the inputs have to be
defined correctly. For example, for clock input, a loop process or an
iterative statement is required.</p>
<p>A final point is that when a VHDL model is translated into the &quot;gates
and wires&quot; that are mapped onto a programmable logic device such as a
CPLD or FPGA, then it is the actual hardware being configured, rather
than the VHDL code being &quot;executed&quot; as if on some form of a processor
chip.</p>

isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer

context virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by
additional logic. VLANs work by applying tags to network packets and
handling these tags in networking systems -- creating the appearance and
functionality of network traffic that is physically on a single network
but acts as if it is split between separate networks. In this way, VLANs
can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the
same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling
and networking devices to be deployed.</p>

<p>Visitor Location Register</p>
<p>The Visitor Location Register (VLR) is a database of the MSs (Mobile
stations) that have roamed into the jurisdiction of the MSC (Mobile
Switching Center) which it serves. Each main base station in the network
is served by exactly one VLR (one BTS may be served by many MSCs in case
of MSC in pool), hence a subscriber cannot be present in more than one
VLR at a time.</p>
<p>The data stored in the VLR has either been received from the Home
Location Register (HLR), or collected from the MS. In practice, for
performance reasons, most vendors integrate the VLR directly to the
V-MSC and, where this is not done, the VLR is very tightly linked with
the MSC via a proprietary interface. Whenever an MSC detects a new MS in
its network, in addition to creating a new record in the VLR, it also
updates the HLR of the mobile subscriber, apprising it of the new
location of that MS. If VLR data is corrupted it can lead to serious
issues with text messaging and call services.</p>

<p>Video On Demand</p>
<p>Video on demand is a programming system which allows users to select and
watch/listen to video or audio content such as movies and TV shows
whenever they choose, rather than at a scheduled broadcast time, the
method that prevailed with over-the-air programming during the 20th
century. IPTV technology is commonly used to bring VOD to televisions
and personal computers.</p>
<p>Television VOD systems can stream content through either a set-top box,
a computer or other device, allowing viewing in real time, or download
it to a device such as a computer, digital video recorder (also called a
personal video recorder) or portable media player for viewing at any
time. The majority of cable- and telephone company-based television
providers offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>VOD streaming, whereby a user selects a video program and it begins
to play immediately on the television set, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>downloading to a digital video recorder (DVR) rented or purchased
from the provider, or downloading onto a PC or to a portable device,
for viewing in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internet television, using the Internet, is an increasingly popular
form of video on demand. VOD can also be accessed via desktop client
applications such as the Apple iTunes online content store.</p>
<p>Some airlines offer VOD as in-flight entertainment to passengers
through individually controlled video screens embedded in seatback
or armrests or offered via portable media players. Some video on
demand services, such as Netflix, use a subscription model that
requires users to pay a monthly fee to access a bundled set of
content, which is mainly movies and TV shows. Other services use an
advertising-based model, where access is free.</p>

<p>Virtual Private LAN Service</p>
<p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a way to provide Ethernet-based
multipoint to multipoint communication over IP or MPLS networks. It
allows geographically dispersed sites to share an Ethernet broadcast
domain by connecting sites through pseudowires. The term 'sites'
includes multiplicities of both servers and clients. The technologies
that can be used as pseudo-wire can be Ethernet over MPLS, L2TPv3 or
even GRE. There are two IETF standards track RFCs (RFC 4761 and RFC
4762) describing VPLS establishment.</p>
<p>VPLS is a virtual private network (VPN) technology. In contrast to
L2TPv3, which allows only point-to-point layer 2 tunnels, VPLS allows
any-to-any (multipoint) connectivity.</p>
<p>In a VPLS, the local area network (LAN) at each site is extended to the
edge of the provider network. The provider network then emulates a
switch or bridge to connect all of the customer LANs to create a single
bridged LAN.</p>
<p>VPLS is designed for applications that require multipoint or broadcast
access.<br />

IoT devices and wearables. It is based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem
(IMS) network, with specific profiles for control and media planes of
voice service on LTE defined by GSMA in PRD IR.92. This approach results
in the voice service (control and media planes) being delivered as data
flows within the LTE data bearer. This means that there is no dependency
on (or ultimately, requirement for) the legacy circuit-switched voice
network to be maintained. VoLTE has up to three times more voice and
data capacity than 3G UMTS and up to six times more than 2G GSM.
Furthermore, it frees up bandwidth because VoLTE's packets headers are
smaller than those of unoptimized VoIP/LTE.</p>

Instead, each node participates in routing by forwarding data for other
nodes, so the determination of which nodes forward data is made
dynamically on the basis of network connectivity and the routing
algorithm in use.<br />
In the Windows operating system, ad-hoc is a communication mode
(setting) that allows computers to directly communicate with each other
without a router.<br />
Wireless mobile ad hoc networks are self-configuring, dynamic networks
in which nodes are free to move. Wireless networks lack the complexities
of infrastructure setup and administration, enabling devices to create
and join networks &quot;on the fly&quot; -- anywhere, anytime.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wan"><a class="header" href="#wan">WAN</a></h1>
<p>Wide Area Network</p>
<p>A wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunications network or computer
network that extends over a large geographical distance/place. Wide area
networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.</p>
<p>Business, education and government entities use wide area networks to
relay data to staff, students, clients, buyers, and suppliers from
various locations across the world. In essence, this mode of
telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily
function regardless of location. The Internet may be considered a WAN.</p>
<p>Related terms for other types of networks are personal area networks
(PANs), local area networks (LANs), campus area networks (CANs), or
metropolitan area networks (MANs) which are usually limited to a room,
building, campus or specific metropolitan area respectively.<br />

<p>Wireless Access Point</p>
<p>In computer networking, a wireless access point (WAP), or more generally
just access point (AP), is a networking hardware device that allows a
Wi-Fi device to connect to a wired network. The AP usually connects to a
router (via a wired network) as a standalone device, but it can also be
an integral component of the router itself. An AP is differentiated from
a hotspot, which is the physical location where Wi-Fi access to a WLAN
is available.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wbcc"><a class="header" href="#wbcc">WBCC</a></h1>
<p>Wholesale Broadband Connect Converge</p>
<p>There is relatively little public information available about this
product. It is known to roll the voice and broadband products in to a
package, with BT providing the ISP a single bill for both. Given that
this product will again be based on WBC, one can only assume that the
same product options and QoS would also be available.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wbc"><a class="header" href="#wbc">WBC</a></h1>
<p>Wholesale Broadband Managed</p>
<p>The vanilla WBC product is the most flexible of the three. Crudely
speaking, it is not that dissimilar to DataStream. But rather than
having to rent capacity at every exchange from BT, the ISP has to
install equipment (&quot;have presence&quot;) at BT's WBC Aggregation Points
(APs). There are twenty of these dotted around the country, and these
are the same as the Core nodes discussed on the 21CN overview. One
aggregation point will cover a region of the country, so an ISP would
need to have presence at all twenty to cover the entire of the UK.<br />

<p>Wholesale Broadband Managed Connect</p>
<p>The IPSC replacement<br />
In the same way that the vanilla WBC product could be seen as a
replacement for DataStream, WBMC can be seen as a replacement for
IPStream. This product is an end-to-end product, encompassing the EUA
(End User Access), presence at the APs (Aggregation Points), EPs
(Extension Paths) and an MSIL (Although the MSIL is purchased separately
by the ISP). Ultimately this saves the ISP having to manage and maintain
presence at the 20 WBC nodes (APs), which would involve considerable
initial outlay and ongoing investment. The backhaul is also managed by
BT entirely. On the other side of the coin this means the ISP is locked
in to a BT platform - which may not necessarily be the cheapest - and it
certainly does not offer all of the flexibility that an ISP using WBC
would receive. That said, all of the same products and QoS options are
available on WBMC as on WBC.</p>

<p>Wired Equivalent Privacy</p>
<p>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security algorithm for IEEE 802.11
wireless networks. Introduced as part of the original 802.11 standard
ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide data confidentiality
comparable to that of a traditional wired network. WEP, recognizable by
its key of 10 or 26 hexadecimal digits (40 or 104 bits), was at one time
widely in use and was often the first security choice presented to users
by router configuration tools.</p>
<p>In 2003 the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP had been superseded by
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). In 2004, with the ratification of the full
802.11i standard (i.e. WPA2), the IEEE declared that both WEP-40 and
WEP-104 have been deprecated.</p>
<p>WEP was the only encryption protocol available to 802.11a and 802.11b
devices built before the WPA standard, which was available for 802.11g
devices.</p>

<p>Warfighter Information Network - Tactical</p>
<p>WIN-T is the U.S. Army's tactical network backbone, providing secure
voice and data communications for soldiers on the battlefield without
the need for fixed infrastructure. By connecting soldiers with their
commanders, WIN-T is changing the way the U.S. Army fights by providing
life-saving information on-the-move, anywhere in the world. WIN-T
enables soldiers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stream real-time video over the network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View a topographical map of friendly forces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send texts requesting medical assistance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digitally call for artillery support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access mission command apps like CPOF and TIGR</p>
<p>WIN-T INCREMENT 1: COMMUNICATIONS AT-THE-HALT<br />
Originally known as the Joint Network Node Network (JNN-N) program,
WIN-T Increment 1 (Inc. 1) began fielding in 2004 to support combat
missions during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi
Freedom.</p>
<p>With WIN-T Inc. 1, for the first time in history, the soldiers on
the battlefield had a high-speed, interoperable voice and data
communications network at the battalion level.</p>
<p>WIN-T INCREMENT 2: COMMUNICATIONS ON-THE-MOVE<br />
The Army's 10th Mountain Division was the first to field WIN-T
Inc. 2 new capabilities when they deployed for Afghanistan in
July 2013. WIN-T Inc. 2's unique value was immediately recognized,
as it provided soldiers with communications even as fixed
infrastructure was removed.</p>
<p>The Tactical Communication Nodes in Inc. 2 took the first step in
providing a mobile infrastructure on the battlefield. This includes
mobile Point Of Presence systems (installed on select vehicles at
battalion levels and above, which include four companies of up to
200 soldiers and about 10 to 30 vehicles each), vehicle wireless
packages, and the Soldier Network Extension (for Company-level
connectivity).</p>
<p>Increment 2 enables mission command from brigade to division to
company through a completely ad-hoc, self-forming network.
Commanders and select staff now have the ability to maneuver
anywhere on the battlefield and maintain connectivity to the
network, without the need to stop and set up communications, making
them vulnerable to attack.</p>

subscribers.</p>
<p>With WLR the alternative telecoms provider buys a wholesale product from
the incumbent (usually in conjunction with a wholesale call product such
as CPS) and is then able to produce a single bill for the end user
covering calls and line rental. Broadband services can also be provided
by the WLR operator (and included in a single bill) if a separate
wholesale DSL product is purchased from the incumbent, but this is
optional.</p>

proprietary technology that forms part of the Windows Media framework.
WMA consists of four distinct codecs. The original WMA codec, known
simply as WMA, was conceived as a competitor to the popular MP3 and
RealAudio codecs. WMA Pro, a newer and more advanced codec, supports
multichannel and high resolution audio. A lossless codec, WMA Lossless,
compresses audio data without loss of audio fidelity (the regular WMA
format is lossy).[3] WMA Voice, targeted at voice content, applies
compression using a range of low bit rates.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi Protected Access</p>
<p>Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) are
two security protocols and security certification programs developed by
the Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks. The Alliance
defined these in response to serious weaknesses researchers had found in
the previous system, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).</p>
<p>WPA (sometimes referred to as the draft IEEE 802.11i standard) became
available in 2003. The Wi-Fi Alliance intended it as an intermediate
measure in anticipation of the availability of the more secure and
complex WPA2, which became available in 2004 and is a common shorthand
for the full IEEE 802.11i (or IEEE 802.11i-2004) standard.</p>

<p>The waterfall model is a relatively linear sequential design approach
for certain areas of engineering design. In software development, it
tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as
progress flows in largely one direction (&quot;downwards&quot; like a waterfall)
through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design,
construction, testing, deployment and maintenance.</p>
<p>The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and
construction industries; where the highly structured physical
environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive
much sooner in the development process. When first adopted for software
development, there were no recognized alternatives for knowledge-based
creative work</p>
<p>The Waterfall methodology came about by mistake due to a
misunderstanding a 1970 paper which gave it as an example of a
methodology along with a comment that states this is a risky method and
invites failure. A US Department of Defense standard was published in
1985 with a methodology based on the 1970 paper and it then became
widespread.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi or WiFi is technology for radio wireless local area networking of
devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. Wi Fi is a trademark of the
Wi-Fi Alliance, which restricts the use of the term Wi-Fi Certified to
products that successfully complete interoperability certification
testing.</p>
<p>Devices that can use Wi-Fi technology include desktops and laptops,
video game consoles, smartphones and tablets, smart TVs, digital audio
players and modern printers. Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the
Internet via a WLAN and a wireless access point. Such an access point
(or hotspot) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a
greater range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single
room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square
kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points.</p>
<p>Depiction of a device sending information wirelessly to another device,
both connected to the local network, in order to print a document<br />
Wi-Fi most commonly uses the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5.8 gigahertz
(5 cm) SHF ISM radio bands, these bands are subdivided into multiple
channels. Each channel can be time-shared by multiple networks. These
wavelengths work best for line-of-sight. Many common materials absorb or
reflect them, which further restricts range, but can tend to help
minimise interference between different networks in crowded
environments. At close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on
suitable hardware[disambiguation needed] can achieve speeds of over 1
Gbps.</p>
<p>Anyone within range with a wireless network interface controller can
attempt to access a network; because of this, Wi-Fi is more vulnerable
to attack (called eavesdropping) than wired networks. Wi-Fi Protected
Access is a family of technologies created to protect information moving
across Wi-Fi networks and includes solutions for personal and enterprise
networks. Security features of Wi-Fi Protected Access have included
stronger protections and new security practices as the security

standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems.
Some wiki engines are open source, whereas others are proprietary. Some

editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others
may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may be
imposed to organize content.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="w/./images/15009225.png?width=479" alt="" /><br />
A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a communications network made up of
radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. It is also a form of wireless
ad hoc network.</p>
<p>A mesh refers to rich interconnection among devices or nodes. Wireless
mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways.
Mobility of nodes is less frequent. If nodes were to constantly or
frequently move, the mesh will spend more time updating routes than
delivering data. In a wireless mesh network, topology tends to be more
static, so that routes computation can converge and delivery of data to
their destinations can occur. Hence, this is a low-mobility centralized
form of wireless ad hoc network. Also, because it sometimes relies on
static nodes to act as gateways, it is not a truly all-wireless ad hoc
network.</p>
<p>The mesh clients are often laptops, cell phones and other wireless
devices while the mesh routers forward traffic to and from the gateways
which may, but need not, be connected to the Internet. The coverage area
of the radio nodes working as a single network is sometimes called a
mesh cloud. Access to this mesh cloud is dependent on the radio nodes
working in harmony with each other to create a radio network. A mesh
network is reliable and offers redundancy. When one node can no longer
operate, the rest of the nodes can still communicate with each other,
directly or through one or more intermediate nodes. Wireless mesh
networks can self form and self heal. Wireless mesh networks work with
different wireless technologies including 802.11, 802.15, 802.16,
cellular technologies and need not be restricted to any one technology
or protocol.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wireless-repeater"><a class="header" href="#wireless-repeater">Wireless Repeater</a></h1>
<p>A wireless repeater (also called wireless range extender) takes an
existing signal from a wireless router or wireless access point and
rebroadcasts it to create a second network. When two or more hosts have
to be connected with one another over the IEEE 802.11 protocol and the
distance is too long for a direct connection to be established, a
wireless repeater is used to bridge the gap. It can be a specialized
stand alone computer networking device. Also, some Wireless network
interface controllers (WNIC)s optionally support operating in such a
mode. Those outside of the primary network will be able to connect
through the new &quot;repeated&quot; network. However, as far as the original
router or access point is concerned, only the repeater MAC is connected,
making it necessary to enable safety features on the wireless repeater.
Wireless repeaters are commonly used to improve signal range and
strength within homes and small offices.</p>

<p>X.25 was originally defined by the International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and
finalized in a publication known as The Orange Book in 1976.</p>
<p>X.25 networks were popular during the 1980s with telecommunications
companies and in financial transaction systems such as automated teller
machines. However, most uses have moved to internet protocol (IP)
systems instead. X.25 is still used (e.g., as of 2012 in the credit card
payment industry) and available in niche applications.</p>

<p>In cryptography, X.509 is an International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
standard defining the format of public key certificates. X.509
certificates are used in many Internet protocols, including TLS/SSL,
which is the basis for HTTPS, the secure protocol for browsing the web.
They are also used in offline applications, like electronic signatures.</p>
<p>An X.509 certificate binds an identity to a public key using a digital
signature. A certificate contains an identity (a hostname, or an
organization, or an individual) and a public key (RSA, DSA, ECDSA,
ed25519, etc.), and is either signed by a certificate authority or is
self-signed. When a certificate is signed by a trusted certificate
authority, or validated by other means, someone holding that certificate
can use the public key it contains to establish secure communications
with another party, or validate documents digitally signed by the
corresponding private key.</p>
<p>X.509 also defines certificate revocation lists, which are a means to
distribute information about certificates that have been deemed invalid
by a signing authority, as well as a certification path validation
algorithm, which allows for certificates to be signed by intermediate CA
certificates, which are, in turn, signed by other certificates,
eventually reaching a trust anchor.</p>
<p>X.509 is defined by the International Telecommunications Union's
&quot;Standardization Sector&quot; (ITU-T), in ITU-T Study Group 17 and is based
on ASN.1, another ITU-T standard.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="xml-schema"><a class="header" href="#xml-schema">XML Schema</a></h1>
<p>An XML schema is a description of a type of XML document, typically
expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of
documents of that type, above and beyond the basic syntactical
constraints imposed by XML itself. These constraints are generally
expressed using some combination of grammatical rules governing the
order of elements, Boolean predicates that the content must satisfy,
data types governing the content of elements and attributes, and more
specialized rules such as uniqueness and referential integrity
constraints.</p>
<p>There are languages developed specifically to express XML schemas. The
Document Type Definition (DTD) language, which is native to the XML
specification, is a schema language that is of relatively limited
capability, but that also has other uses in XML aside from the
expression of schemas. Two more expressive XML schema languages in
widespread use are XML Schema (with a capital S) and RELAX NG.</p>
<p>The mechanism for associating an XML document with a schema varies
according to the schema language. The association may be achieved via
markup within the XML document itself, or via some external means.</p>

<p>XML-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol which uses XML to
encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism. &quot;XML-RPC&quot; also
refers generically to the use of XML for remote procedure call,
independently of the specific protocol. This article is about the
protocol named &quot;XML-RPC&quot;.</p>

<p>Extensible Markup Language</p>
<p>In computing, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that
defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both
human-readable and machine-readable. The W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and
several other related specifications---all of them free open
standards---define XML.</p>
<p>The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability
across the Internet.[5] It is a textual data format with strong
support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design
of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the
representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web
services.</p>
<p>Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based
languages, while programmers have developed many application programming
interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="xmpp"><a class="header" href="#xmpp">XMPP</a></h1>
<p>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocols</p>
<p>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a communication
protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup
Language). It enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet
extensible data between any two or more network entities. Originally
named Jabber, the protocol was developed by the Jabber open-source
community in 1999 for near real-time instant messaging (IM), presence
information, and contact list maintenance. Designed to be extensible,
the protocol has been used also for publish-subscribe systems,
signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, the Internet of
Things (IoT) applications such as the smart grid, and social networking
services.</p>
<p>Unlike most instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open
standard and uses an open systems approach of development and
application, by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and
interoperate with other organizations' implementations. Because XMPP is
an open protocol, implementations can be developed using any software
license and many server, client, and library implementations are
distributed as free and open-source software, numerous freeware and
commercial software implementations also exist.</p>
<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed an XMPP working group
in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and
presence technology. The XMPP Working group produced four specifications
(RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923), which were approved as
Proposed Standards in 2004. In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were
superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122
specifying the XMPP address format. In 2015, RFC 6122 was superseded by
RFC 7622. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF,
the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation)
is active in developing open XMPP extensions.</p>

<p>Cross Site Scripting</p>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability
typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject
client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site
scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access
controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried
out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security
vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007. Bug bounty company
HackerOne in 2017 reported that XSS is still a major threat vector. XSS
effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk,
depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site
and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's
owner.</p>

<p>XSD (XML Schema Definition), a recommendation of the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an
Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers
to verify each piece of item content in a document. They can check if it
adheres to the description of the element it is placed in.</p>
<p>Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules
to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered &quot;valid&quot;
according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages,
XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document's
validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific
data types. Such a post-validation infoset can be useful in the
development of XML document processing software.</p>

<p>YAML Ain't Markup Language</p>
<p>YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly
used for configuration files and in applications where data is being
stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications
applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal
syntax which intentionally differs from SGML. It uses both Python-style
indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses
[...] for lists and {...} for maps thus JSON files are valid YAML 1.2.</p>
<p>Custom data types are allowed, but YAML natively encodes scalars (such
as strings, integers, and floats), lists, and associative arrays (also
known as maps, dictionaries or hashes). These data types are based on
the Perl programming language, though all commonly used high-level
programming languages share very similar concepts. The colon-centered
syntax, used for expressing key-value pairs, is inspired by electronic
mail headers as defined in RFC 822, and the document separator --- is
borrowed from MIME (RFC 2046). Escape sequences are reused from C, and
whitespace wrapping for multi-line strings is inspired by HTML. Lists
and hashes can contain nested lists and hashes, forming a tree
structure; arbitrary graphs can be represented using YAML aliases
(similar to XML in SOAP). YAML is intended to be read and written in
streams, a feature inspired by SAX.</p>
<p>The official recommended filename extension for YAML files is .yaml</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="zigbee"><a class="header" href="#zigbee">ZigBee</a></h1>
<p>Zigbee is an IEEE 802.15.4-based specification for a suite of high-level
communication protocols used to create personal area networks with
small, low-power digital radios, such as for home automation, medical
device data collection, and other low-power low-bandwidth needs,
designed for small scale projects which need wireless connection. Hence,
Zigbee is a low-power, low data rate, and close proximity (i.e.,
personal area) wireless ad hoc network.</p>
<p>The technology defined by the Zigbee specification is intended to be
simpler and less expensive than other wireless personal area networks
(WPANs), such as Bluetooth or more general wireless networking such as
Wi-Fi. Applications include wireless light switches, home energy
monitors, traffic management systems, and other consumer and industrial
equipment that requires short-range low-rate wireless data transfer.</p>
<p>Its low power consumption limits transmission distances to 10--100
meters line-of-sight, depending on power output and environmental
characteristics. Zigbee devices can transmit data over long distances by
passing data through a mesh network of intermediate devices to reach
more distant ones. Zigbee is typically used in low data rate
applications that require long battery life and secure networking
(Zigbee networks are secured by 128 bit symmetric encryption keys.)
Zigbee has a defined rate of 250 kbit/s, best suited for intermittent
data transmissions from a sensor or input device.</p>

<p>The µ-law algorithm (sometimes written &quot;mu-law&quot;, often approximated as
&quot;u-law&quot;) is a companding algorithm, primarily used in 8-bit PCM digital
telecommunication systems in North America and Japan. It is one of two
versions of the G.711 standard from ITU-T, the other version being the
similar A-law, used in regions where digital telecommunication signals
are carried on E-1 circuits, e.g. Europe.</p>
<p>Companding algorithms reduce the dynamic range of an audio signal. In
analog systems, this can increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
achieved during transmission; in the digital domain, it can reduce the
quantization error (hence increasing signal to quantization noise
ratio). These SNR increases can be traded instead for reduced bandwidth
for equivalent SNR.</p>
