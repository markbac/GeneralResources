# .NET


.NET Framework (pronounced dot net) is a software framework developed by
Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a
large class library named Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides
language interoperability (each language can use code written in other
languages) across several programming languages. Programs
written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in
contrast to a hardware environment) named Common Language Runtime (CLR),
an application virtual machine that provides services such as security,
memory management, and exception handling. (As such, computer code
written using .NET Framework is called "managed code".) FCL and CLR
together constitute .NET Framework.

FCL provides user interface, data access, database connectivity,
cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, and
network communications. Programmers produce software by combining their
source code with .NET Framework and other libraries. The framework is
intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows
platform. Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment
largely for .NET software called Visual Studio.
