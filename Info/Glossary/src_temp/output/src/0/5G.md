# 5G


5G is a marketing term for some new mobile technologies. Definitions
differ and confusion is common. The ITU IMT-2020 standard provides for
speeds up to 20 gigabits per second and has only been demonstrated with
millimeter waves of 15 gigahertz and higher frequency. The more recent
3GPP standard includes any network using the NR New Radio software. 5G
New Radio can include lower frequencies, from 600 MHz to 6 GHz. However,
the speeds in these lower frequencies are only modestly higher than new
4G systems, estimated at 15% to 50% faster. At least at the lower
frequencies, "5G is evolutionary."
