# AAC


Advanced Audio Coding

Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a proprietary audio coding standard for
lossy digital audio compression. Designed to be the successor of the MP3
format, AAC generally achieves better sound quality than MP3 at the same
bit rate. The confusingly named AAC+ (HE-AAC) does so only at low bit
rates and less so at high ones.

AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC, as part of the MPEG-2 and
MPEG-4 specifications. Part of AAC, HE-AAC (AAC+), is part of MPEG-4
Audio and also adopted into digital radio standards DAB+ and Digital
Radio Mondiale, as well as mobile television standards DVB-H and
ATSC-M/H.

AAC supports inclusion of 48 full-bandwidth (up to 96 kHz) audio
channels in one stream plus 16 low frequency effects (LFE, limited to
120 Hz) channels, up to 16 "coupling" or dialog channels, and up to 16
data streams. The quality for stereo is satisfactory to modest
requirements at 96 kbit/s in joint stereo mode; however, hi-fi
transparency demands data rates of at least 128 kbit/s (VBR). Tests of
MPEG-4 audio have shown that AAC meets the requirements referred to as
"transparent" for the ITU at 128 kbit/s for stereo, and 320 kbit/s for
5.1 audio.
