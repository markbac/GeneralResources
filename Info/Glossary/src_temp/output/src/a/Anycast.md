# Anycast


Anycast is a network addressing and routing methodology in which a
single destination address has multiple routing paths to two or more
endpoint destinations. Routers will select the desired path on the basis
of number of hops, distance, lowest cost, latency measurements or based
on the least congested route. Anycast networks are widely used for CDN
products to bring their content closer to the end user.\
