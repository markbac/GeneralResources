Common Channel Signalling

In telephony, common-channel signaling (CCS), in the US also
common-channel interoffice signaling (CCIS), is the transmission of
signaling information (control information) on a separate channel than
the data, and, more specifically, where that signaling channel controls
multiple data channels.

For example, in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) one channel
of a communications link is typically used for the sole purpose of
carrying signaling for establishment and tear down of telephone calls.
The remaining channels are used entirely for the transmission of voice
data. In most cases, a single 64kbit/s channel is sufficient to handle
the call setup and call clear-down traffic for numerous voice and data
channels.

The logical alternative to CCS is channel-associated signaling (CAS), in
which each bearer channel has a signaling channel dedicated to it.

CCS offers the following advantages over CAS, in the context of the
PSTN:

- Faster call set-up time

- Greater trunking efficiency due to the quicker set up and clearing,
    thereby reducing traffic on the network

- Can transfer additional information along with the signaling
    traffic, providing features such as caller ID

- Signaling can be performed mid-call

    The most common CCS signaling methods in use today are Integrated
    Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Signalling System No.Â 7 (SS7).

    ISDN signaling is used primarily on trunks connecting end-user
    private branch exchange (PBX) systems to a central office. SS7 is
    primarily used within the PSTN. The two signaling methods are very
    similar since they share a common heritage and in some cases, the
    same signaling messages are transmitted in both ISDN and SS7.
