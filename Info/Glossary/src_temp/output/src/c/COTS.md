# COTS


Commercial off-the-shelf

Commercial off-the-shelf or commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS)
is a term used to describe the purchase of packaged solutions which are
then adapted to satisfy the needs of the purchasing organization, rather
than the commissioning of custom-made, or bespoke, solutions. A related
term, Mil-COTS, refers to COTS products for use by the U.S. military.

In the context of the U.S. government, the Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) has defined "COTS" as a formal term for commercial
items, including services, available in the commercial marketplace that
can be bought and used under government contract. For example, Microsoft
is a COTS software provider. Goods and construction materials may
qualify as COTS but bulk cargo does not. Services associated with the
commercial items may also qualify as COTS, including installation
services, training services, and cloud services.

COTS purchases are alternatives to custom software or one-off
developments -- government-funded developments or otherwise.

Although COTS products can be used out of the box, in practice the COTS
product must be configured to achieve the needs of the business and
integrated to existing organizational systems. Extending the
functionality of COTS products via custom development is also an option,
however this decision should be carefully considered due to the long
term support and maintenance implications. Such customized functionality
is not supported by the COTS vendor, so brings its own sets of issues
when upgrading the COTS product.
