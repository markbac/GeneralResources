# CRC Cards


Class Responsibility Collaborator Cards

CRC Cards are an object oriented design technique teams can use to
discuss what a class should know and do and what other classes it
interacts with.

CRC cards are usually created from index cards. Members of a
brainstorming session will write up one CRC card for each relevant
class/object of their design. The card is partitioned into three areas:

- On top of the card, the class name

- On the left, the responsibilities of the class\
    On the right, collaborators (other classes) with which this class
    interacts to fulfill its responsibilities
