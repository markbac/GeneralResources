Centre of Excellence

A center of excellence (COE) is a team, a shared facility or an entity
that provides leadership, best practices, research, support and/or
training for a focus area. The focus area might be a technology
(e.g. Java), a business concept (e.g. BPM), a skill (e.g. negotiation)
or a broad area of study (e.g. women's health). A center of excellence
may also be aimed at revitalizing stalled initiatives.

Within an organization, a center of excellence may refer to a group of
people, a department or a shared facility. It may also be known as a
competency center or a capability center. The term may also refer to a
network of institutions collaborating with each other to pursue
excellence in a particular area.
