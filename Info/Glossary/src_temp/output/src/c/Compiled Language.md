# Compiled Language


A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are
typically compilers (translators that generate machine code from source
code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code,
where no pre-runtime translation takes place).

The term is somewhat vague. In principle, any language can be
implemented with a compiler or with an interpreter. A combination of
both solutions is also common: a compiler can translate the source code
into some intermediate form (often called p-code or bytecode), which is
then passed to an interpreter which executes it.
