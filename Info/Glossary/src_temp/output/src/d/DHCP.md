# DHCP


Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management
protocol used on UDP/IP networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically
assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each
device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks. A
DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking
parameters automatically from the Internet service provider (ISP),
reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to manually
assign IP addresses to all network devices.
