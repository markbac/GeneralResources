Digital Terrestrial TV

Digital terrestrial television (DTTV or DTT) is a technology for
broadcast television in which land-based (terrestrial) television
stations broadcast television content by radio waves to televisions in
consumers' residences in a digital format. DTTV is a major technological
advance over the previous analog television, and has largely replaced
analog which had been in common use since the middle of the last
century. Test broadcasts began in 1998 with the changeover to DTTV (aka
Analog Switchoff (ASO) or Digital Switchover (DSO)) beginning in 2006
and is now complete in many countries. The advantages of digital
terrestrial television are similar to those obtained by digitising
platforms such as cable TV, satellite, and telecommunications: more
efficient use of limited radio spectrum bandwidth, provision of more
television channels than analog, better quality images, and potentially
lower operating costs for broadcasters (after the initial upgrade
costs).
