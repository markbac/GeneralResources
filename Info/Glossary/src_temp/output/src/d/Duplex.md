# Duplex


A duplex communication system is a point-to-point system composed of two
or more connected parties or devices that can communicate with one
another in both directions. Duplex systems are employed in many
communications networks, either to allow for a communication "two-way
street" between two connected parties or to provide a "reverse path" for
the monitoring and remote adjustment of equipment in the field. There
are two types of duplex communication systems: full-duplex (FDX) and
half-duplex (HDX).
