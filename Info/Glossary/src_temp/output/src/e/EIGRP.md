# EIGRP


Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol

Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an advanced
distance-vector routing protocol that is used on a computer network for
automating routing decisions and configuration. The protocol was
designed by Cisco Systems as a proprietary protocol, available only on
Cisco routers. Functionality of EIGRP was converted to an open standard
in 2013\[1\] and was published with informational status as RFC 7868 in
2016.

EIGRP is used on a router to share routes with other routers within the
same autonomous system. Unlike other well known routing protocols, such
as RIP, EIGRP only sends incremental updates, reducing the workload on
the router and the amount of data that needs to be transmitted.

EIGRP replaced the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) in 1993. One
of the major reasons for this was the change to classless IPv4 addresses
in the Internet Protocol, which IGRP could not support.
