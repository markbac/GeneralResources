# Egress


Egress traffic is network traffic that begins inside of a network and
proceeds through its routers to a destination somewhere outside of the
network. For example, an email message that is considered egress traffic
will travel from a user's workstation and pass through the enterprise's
LAN routers before it is delivered to the Internet to travel to its
final destination.\
