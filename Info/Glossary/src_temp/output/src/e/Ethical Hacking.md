# Ethical Hacking


The term "white hat" in Internet slang refers to an ethical computer
hacker, or a computer security expert, who specializes in penetration
testing and in other testing methodologies that ensures the security of
an organization's information systems. Ethical hacking is a term meant
to imply a broader category than just penetration testing. Contrasted
with black hat, a malicious hacker, the name comes from Western films,
where heroic and antagonistic cowboys might traditionally wear a white
and a black hat respectively.
