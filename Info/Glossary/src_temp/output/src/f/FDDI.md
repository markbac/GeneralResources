# FDDI


Fiber Distributed Data Interface

Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a standard for data
transmission in a local area network. It uses optical fiber as its
standard underlying physical medium, although it was also later
specified to use copper cable, in which case it may be called CDDI
(Copper Distributed Data Interface), standardized as TP-PMD
(Twisted-Pair Physical Medium-Dependent), also referred to as TP-DDI
(Twisted-Pair Distributed Data Interface).

FDDI was effectively made obsolete in local networks by Fast Ethernet
which offered the same 100 Mbit/s speeds, but at a much lower cost and,
since 1998, by Gigabit Ethernet due to its speed, and even lower cost,
and ubiquity.
