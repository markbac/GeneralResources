# FTPS


File Transfer Protocol Secure

FTPS (also known as FTPES, FTP-SSL, and FTP Secure) is an extension to
the commonly used File Transfer Protocol (FTP) that adds support for the
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
cryptographic protocols.

FTPS should not be confused with the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP),
a secure file transfer subsystem for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol it
is not compatible with. It is also different from FTP over SSH, the
practice of tunneling FTP through an SSH connection.
