# Fortran


Fortran is a general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language
that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific
computing.

Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering
applications, FORTRAN came to dominate this area of programming early on
and has been in continuous use for over half a century in
computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction,
finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational
physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular
language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that
benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.

Fortran encompasses a lineage of versions, each of which evolved to add
extensions to the language while usually retaining compatibility with
prior versions. Successive versions have added support for structured
programming and processing of character-based data (FORTRAN 77), array
programming, modular programming and generic programming (Fortran 90),
high performance Fortran (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming
(Fortran 2003) and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).

Fortran's design was the basis for many other programming languages.
Among the better known is BASIC, which is a based on FORTRAN II with a
number of syntax cleanups, notably better logical structures, and other
changes to more easily work in an interactive environment.
