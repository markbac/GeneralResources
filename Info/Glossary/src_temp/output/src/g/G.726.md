# G.726


G.726 is an ITU-T ADPCM speech codec standard covering the transmission
of voice at rates of 16, 24, 32, and 40 kbit/s. It was introduced to
supersede both G.721, which covered ADPCM at 32 kbit/s, and G.723, which
described ADPCM for 24 and 40 kbit/s. G.726 also introduced a new 16
kbit/s rate. The four bit rates associated with G.726 are often referred
to by the bit size of a sample, which are 2, 3, 4, and 5-bits
respectively.

The most commonly used mode is 32 kbit/s, which doubles the usable
network capacity by using half the rate of G.711. It is primarily used
on international trunks in the phone network and is the standard codec
used in DECT wireless phone systems. The principal application of 24 and
16 kbit/s channels is for overload channels carrying voice in digital
circuit multiplication equipment (DCME). The principal application of 40
kbit/s channels is to carry data modem signals in DCME, especially for
modems operating at greater than 4800 bit/s.
