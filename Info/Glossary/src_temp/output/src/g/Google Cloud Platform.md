# Google Cloud Platform


Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing
services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses
internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and YouTube.
Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular
cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and
machine learning. Registration requires a credit card or bank account
details.

Google Cloud Platform provides Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as
a Service, and Serverless Computing environments.

In April 2008, Google announced App Engine, a platform for developing
and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers, which was
the first cloud computing service from the company. The service became
generally available in November 2011. Since the announcement of App
Engine, Google added multiple cloud services to the platform.

Google Cloud Platform is a part of Google Cloud, which includes the
Google Cloud Platform public cloud infrastructure, as well as G Suite,
enterprise versions of Android and Chrome OS, and application
programming interfaces (APIs) for machine learning and Google Maps
