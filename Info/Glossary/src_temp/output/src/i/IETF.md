# IETF


Internet Engineering Task Force

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) develops and promotes
voluntary Internet standards, in particular the standards that comprise
the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP). It is an open standards
organization, with no formal membership or membership requirements. All
participants and managers are volunteers, though their work is usually
funded by their employers or sponsors.

The IETF started out as an activity supported by the U.S. federal
government, but since 1993 it has operated as a standards development
function under the auspices of the Internet Society, an international
membership-based non-profit organization.
