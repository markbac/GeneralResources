is responsible for issues that concern information and communication
technologies.\[1\]

The ITU coordinates the shared global use of the radio spectrum,
promotes international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, works
to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world, and
assists in the development and coordination of worldwide technical
standards. The ITU is active in areas including broadband Internet,
latest-generation wireless technologies, aeronautical and maritime
navigation, radio astronomy, satellite-based meteorology, convergence in
fixed-mobile phone, Internet access, data, voice, TV broadcasting, and
next-generation networks. The agency also organizes worldwide and
regional exhibitions and forums, such as ITU Telecom World, bringing
together representatives of government and the telecommunications and
ICT industry to exchange ideas, knowledge and technology.
