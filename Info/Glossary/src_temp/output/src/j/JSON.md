# JSON


JavaScript Object Notation

In computing, JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is an open-standard
file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects
consisting of attribute--value pairs and array data types (or any other
serializable value). It is a very common data format
used for asynchronous browser--server communication, including as a
replacement for XML in some AJAX-style systems.

JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from
JavaScript, but as of 2017 many programming languages include code to
generate and parse JSON-format data. The official Internet media
type for JSON is application/json. JSON filenames use the extension
.json.\
