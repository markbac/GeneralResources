# K & R indent style


The K&R style is commonly used in C, C++, and other curly brace
programming languages. Used in Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C
Programming Language, it had its origins in Kernighan and Plauger's The
Elements of Programming Style.

When following K&R, each function has its opening brace at the next line
on the same indentation level as its header, the statements within the
braces are indented, and the closing brace at the end is on the same
indentation level as the header of the function at a line of its own.

The blocks inside a function, however, have their opening braces at the
same line as their respective control statements; closing braces remain
in a line of their own, unless followed by a keyword else or while. Such
non-aligned braces are nicknamed "Egyptian braces" (or "Egyptian
brackets") for their resemblance to arms in some fanciful poses of
ancient Egyptians.
