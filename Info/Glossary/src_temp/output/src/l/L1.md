Layer 1

In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the physical layer
or layer 1 is the first and lowest layer. This layer may be implemented
by a PHY chip.

The physical layer consists of the electronic circuit transmission
technologies of a network. It is a fundamental layer underlying the
higher level functions in a network. Due to the plethora of available
hardware technologies with widely varying characteristics, this is
perhaps the most complex layer in the OSI architecture.

The physical layer defines the means of transmitting raw bits rather
than logical data packets over a physical data link connecting network
nodes. The bitstream may be grouped into code words or symbols and
converted to a physical signal that is transmitted over a transmission
medium. The physical layer provides an electrical, mechanical, and
procedural interface to the transmission medium. The shapes and
properties of the electrical connectors, the frequencies to broadcast
on, the line code to use and similar low-level parameters, are specified
here.\
