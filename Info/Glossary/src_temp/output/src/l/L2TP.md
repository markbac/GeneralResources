# L2TP


Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol

In computer networking, Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a tunneling
protocol used to support virtual private networks (VPNs) or as part of
the delivery of services by ISPs. It does not provide any encryption or
confidentiality by itself. Rather, it relies on an encryption protocol
that it passes within the tunnel to provide privacy.
