Layer 2 Virtual Private Network

A Layer 2 MPLS VPN is a term in computer networking. It is a method that
Internet service providers use to segregate their network for their
customers, to allow them to transmit data over an IP network. This is
often sold as a service to businesses.

Layer 2 VPNs are a type of Virtual Private Network (VPN) that uses MPLS
labels to transport data. The communication occurs between routers that
are known as Provider Edge routers (PEs), as they sit on the edge of the
provider's network, next to the customer's network.

Internet providers who have an existing Layer 2 network (such as ATM or
Frame Relay) may choose to use these VPNs instead of the other common
MPLS VPN, Layer 3. There is no one IETF standard for Layer 2 MPLS VPNs.
Instead, two methodologies may be used. Both methods use a standard MPLS
header to encapsulate data. However, they differ in their signaling
protocols.
