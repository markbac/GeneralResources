# LANE


ATM LAN Emulation

LAN Emulation (LANE) is a technology that allows an ATM network to
function as a LAN backbone. The ATM network must provide multicast and
broadcast support, address mapping (MAC-to-ATM), SVC management, and a
usable packet format. LANE also defines Ethernet and Token Ring ELANs.
