# Linux


Linux is a family of free and open-source software operating systems
built around the Linux kernel. Typically, Linux is packaged in a form
known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop and
server use. The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux
kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991,
by Linus Torvalds. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in
their name. The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to
refer to the operating system family, as well as specific distributions,
to emphasize that most Linux distributions are not just the Linux
kernel, and that they have in common not only the kernel, but also
numerous utilities and libraries, a large proportion of which are from
the GNU project.\

Widely used distributions

- Debian, a non-commercial distribution and one of the earliest,
    maintained by a volunteer developer community with a strong
    commitment to free software principles and democratic project
    management

  - Knoppix, the first Live CD distribution to run completely from
        removable media without installation to a hard disk, derived
        from Debian

  - Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE) uses Debian packages directly
        (rather than Ubuntu's)

  - Ubuntu, a desktop and server distribution derived from Debian,
        maintained by British company Canonical Ltd.

    - Kubuntu, the KDE version of Ubuntu

    - Linux Mint, a distribution based on and compatible with
            Ubuntu. Supports multiple desktop environments, among others
            GNOME Shell fork Cinnamon and GNOME 2 fork MATE.

    - Trisquel, an Ubuntu-based distribution based on Linux-libre
            kernel composed entirely of free software

    - Elementary OS, an Ubuntu-based distribution with strong
            focus on the visual experience without sacrificing
            performance.

- Fedora, a community distribution sponsored by American company Red
    Hat and the successor to the company's previous offering, Red Hat
    Linux. It aims to be a technology testbed for Red Hat's commercial
    Linux offering, where new open source software is prototyped,
    developed, and tested in a communal setting before maturing into Red
    Hat Enterprise Linux.

  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), a derivative of Fedora,
        maintained and commercially supported by Red Hat. It seeks to
        provide tested, secure, and stable Linux server and workstation
        support to businesses.

    - CentOS, a distribution derived from the same sources used by
            Red Hat, maintained by a dedicated volunteer community of
            developers with both 100% Red Hat-compatible versions and an
            upgraded version that is not always 100% upstream
            compatible.

    - Oracle Linux, which is a derivative of Red Hat Enterprise
            Linux, maintained and commercially supported by Oracle

    - Scientific Linux, a distribution derived from the same
            sources used by Red Hat, maintained by Fermilab

- Mandriva Linux was a Red Hat derivative popular in several European
    countries and Brazil, backed by the French company of the same name.
    After the company went bankrupt, it was superseded by OpenMandriva
    Lx,\[20\]\[21\] although a number of derivatives now have a larger
    user base.

  - Mageia, a community fork of Mandriva Linux created in 2010

  - PCLinuxOS, a derivative of Mandriva, which grew from a group of
        packages into a community-spawned desktop distribution

  - ROSA Linux, another former derivative of Mandriva, now developed
        independently

- openSUSE, a community distribution mainly sponsored by German
    company SUSE.

  - SUSE Linux Enterprise, derived from openSUSE, maintained and
        commercially supported by SUSE

- Arch Linux, a rolling release distribution targeted at experienced
    Linux users and maintained by a volunteer community, offers official
    binary packages and a wide range of unofficial user-submitted source
    packages. Packages are usually defined by a single PKGBUILD text
    file.

  - Manjaro Linux, a derivative of Arch Linux that includes a
        graphical installer and other ease-of-use features for less
        experienced Linux users. Rolling release packages from Arch
        repositories are held for further testing to achieve increased
        stability, and packages identified as addressing security issues
        of critical or high severity are "fast-tracked" to the stable
        branch.

- Gentoo, a distribution targeted at power users, known for its
    FreeBSD Ports-like automated system for compiling applications from
    source code

  - Chrome OS, Google's commercial operating system (using Gentoo
        and its Portage) that primarily runs web applications

  - Chromium OS, the fully open-source version of Chrome OS

- Slackware, created in 1993, one of the first Linux distributions and
    among the earliest still maintained, committed to remain highly
    Unix-like and easily modifiable by end users
