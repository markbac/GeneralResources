# MOS


Mean Opinion Score

Mean opinion score (MOS) is a measure used in the domain of Quality of
Experience and telecommunications engineering, representing overall
quality of a stimulus or system. It is the arithmetic mean over all
individual "values on a predefined scale that a subject assigns to his
opinion of the performance of a system quality". Such ratings are
usually gathered in a subjective quality evaluation test, but they can
also be algorithmically estimated.

MOS is a commonly used measure for video, audio, and audiovisual quality
evaluation, but not restricted to those modalities. ITU-T has defined
several ways of referring to a MOS in Recommendation P.800.1, depending
on whether the score was obtained from audiovisual, conversational,
listening, talking, or video quality tests.\
