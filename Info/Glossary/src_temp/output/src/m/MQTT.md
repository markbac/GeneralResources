# MQTT


Message Queuing Telemetry Transport

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC
PRF 20922) publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on top
of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote
locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network
bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a
message broker.

Andy Stanford-Clark of IBM and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link authored the
first version of the protocol in 1999.

The specification does not specify the meaning of "small code footprint"
or the meaning of "limited network bandwidth". Thus, the protocol's
availability for use depends on the context. In 2013, IBM submitted MQTT
v3.1 to the OASIS specification body with a charter that ensured only
minor changes to the specification could be accepted. MQTT-SN is a
variation of the main protocol aimed at embedded devices on non-TCP/IP
networks, such as ZigBee.

Historically, the "MQ" in "MQTT" came from IBM's MQ Series message
queuing product line.\[6\] However, queuing itself is not required to be
supported as a standard feature in all situations.
