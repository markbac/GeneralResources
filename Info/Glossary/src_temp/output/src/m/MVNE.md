# MVNE


mobile virtual network enabler

A mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE) is a company that provides
network infrastructure and related services, such as business support
systems, administration and operations support systems to a Mobile
Virtual Network Operator (MVNO). This enables MVNOs to offer services to
their own customers with their own brands. The MVNE does not have a
relationship with consumers, but rather is a provider of network
enablement platforms and services.
