# MVNO


Mobile Virtual Network Operator

A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), virtual network operator
(VNO), or mobile other licensed operator (MOLO), is a wireless
communications services provider that does not own the wireless network
infrastructure over which it provides services to its customers. An MVNO
enters into a business agreement with a mobile network operator to
obtain bulk access to network services at wholesale rates, then sets
retail prices independently. An MVNO may use its own customer service,
billing support systems, marketing, and sales personnel, or it could
employ the services of a mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE).
