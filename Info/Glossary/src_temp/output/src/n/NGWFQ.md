Weighted Fair Queueing

See PWFQ\
Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) is a network scheduler scheduling
algorithm. WFQ is both a packet-based implementation of the generalized
processor sharing (GPS) policy, and a natural extension of fair queuing
(FQ). Whereas FQ shares the link's capacity in equal subparts, WFQ
allows schedulers to specify, for each flow, which fraction of the
capacity will be given.

Weighted fair queuing is also known as packet-by-packet GPS (PGPS or
P-GPS) since it approximates generalized processor sharing "to within
one packet transmission time, regardless of the arrival patterns."\
