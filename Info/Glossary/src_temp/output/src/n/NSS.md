Network switching subsystem

Network switching subsystem (NSS) (or GSM core network) is the component
of a GSM system that carries out call out and mobility management
functions for mobile phones roaming on the network of base stations. It
is owned and deployed by mobile phone operators and allows mobile
devices to communicate with each other and telephones in the wider
public switched telephone network4g LET(PSTN). The architecture contains
specific features and functions which are needed because the phones are
not fixed in one location.

The NSS originally consisted of the circuit-switched core network, used
for traditional GSM services such as voice calls, SMS, and circuit
switched data calls. It was extended with an overlay architecture to
provide packet-switched data services known as the GPRS core network.
This allows mobile phones to have access to services such as WAP, MMS
and the Internet.\
