Optical fiber connector

An optical fiber connector terminates the end of an optical fiber, and
enables quicker connection and disconnection than splicing. The
connectors mechanically couple and align the cores of fibers so light
can pass. Better connectors lose very little light due to reflection or
misalignment of the fibers. In all, about 100 different types of fiber
optic connectors have been introduced to the market.\
