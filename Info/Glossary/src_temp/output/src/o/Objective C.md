# Objective C


Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language
that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. It
was the main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS
operating systems, and their respective application programming
interfaces (APIs) Cocoa and Cocoa Touch prior to the introduction of
Swift.
