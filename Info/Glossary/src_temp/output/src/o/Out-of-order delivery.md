# Out-of-order delivery


In computer networking, out-of-order delivery is the delivery of data
packets in a different order from which they were sent. Out-of-order
delivery can be caused by packets following multiple paths through a
network, or via parallel processing paths within network equipment that
are not designed to ensure that packet ordering is preserved. One of the
functions of TCP is to prevent the out-of-order delivery of data, either
by reassembling packets into order or forcing retries of out-of-order
packets.\
