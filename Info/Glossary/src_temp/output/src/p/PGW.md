# PGW


Packet Data Network Gateway

The PDN Gateway provides connectivity from the UE to external packet
data networks by being the point of exit and entry of traffic for the
UE. A UE may have simultaneous connectivity with more than one PGW for
accessing multiple PDNs. The PGW performs policy enforcement, packet
filtering for each user, charging support, lawful interception and
packet screening. Another key role of the PGW is to act as the anchor
for mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP technologies such as WiMAX and
3GPP2 (CDMA 1X and EvDO).
