# POSIX


The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards
specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility
between operating systems. POSIX defines the application programming
interface (API), along with command line shells and utility
interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of Unix and other
operating systems.
