Point-to-Point Protocol

In computer networking, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link
layer (layer 2) communications protocol used to establish a direct
connection between two nodes. It connects two routers directly without
any host or any other networking device in between. It can provide
connection authentication, transmission encryption,\[1\] and
compression.

PPP is used over many types of physical networks including serial cable,
phone line, trunk line, cellular telephone, specialized radio links, and
fiber optic links such as SONET. Internet service providers (ISPs) have
used PPP for customer dial-up access to the Internet, since IP packets
cannot be transmitted over a modem line on their own, without some data
link protocol.

Two derivatives of PPP, Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)
and Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA), are used most commonly by
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to establish a Digital Subscriber Line
(DSL) Internet service connection with customers.
