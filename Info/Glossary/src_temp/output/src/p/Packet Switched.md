# Packet Switched


Packet switching is a method of grouping data which is transmitted over
a digital network into packets which are made of a header and a payload.
Data in the header is used by networking hardware to direct the packet
to its destination where the payload is extracted and used by
application software. Packet switching is the primary basis for data
communications in computer networks worldwide.
