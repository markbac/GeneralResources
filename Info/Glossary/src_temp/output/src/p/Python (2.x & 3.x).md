# Python (2.x & 3.x)


Python is an interpreted high-level programming
language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum
and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that
emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It
provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and
large scales. In July 2018, the creator Van Rossum stepped down as the
leader in the language community after 30 years.

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive
standard library

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 and had many
major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and
support for Unicode. With this release, the development process became
more transparent and community-backed.

Python 3.0 (initially called Python 3000 or py3k) was released on 3
December 2008 after a long testing period. It is a major revision of the
language that is not completely backward-compatible with previous
versions. However, many of its major features have been backported to
the Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series, and releases of Python 3
include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2
code to Python 3
