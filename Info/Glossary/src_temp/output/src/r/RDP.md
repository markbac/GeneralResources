# RDP


Remote Desktop Protocol

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by
Microsoft, which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect
to another computer over a network connection. The user employs RDP
client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP
server software.

Clients exist for most versions of Microsoft Windows (including Windows
Mobile), Linux, Unix, macOS, iOS, Android, and other operating systems.
RDP servers are built into Windows operating systems; an RDP server for
Unix and OS X also exists. By default, the server listens on TCP port
3389\[1\] and UDP port 3389.\[2\]

Microsoft currently refers to their official RDP client software as
Remote Desktop Connection, formerly "Terminal Services Client".

The protocol is an extension of the ITU-T T.128 application sharing
protocol.
