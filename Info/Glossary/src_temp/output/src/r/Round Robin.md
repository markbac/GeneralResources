# Round Robin


Round-robin (RR) is one of the algorithms employed by process and
network schedulers in computing. As the term is generally used, time
slices (also known as time quanta) are assigned to each process in equal
portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority
(also known as cyclic executive). Round-robin scheduling is simple, easy
to implement, and starvation-free. Round-robin scheduling can also be
applied to other scheduling problems, such as data packet scheduling in
computer networks. It is an operating system concept.

The name of the algorithm comes from the round-robin principle known
from other fields, where each person takes an equal share of something
in turn.\
