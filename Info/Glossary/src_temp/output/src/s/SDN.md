Software Defined Network

Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is an approach to cloud
computing that facilitates network management and enables
programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve
network performance and monitoring. SDN is meant to address the fact
that the static architecture of traditional networks is decentralized
and complex while current networks require more flexibility and easy
troubleshooting. SDN suggests to centralize network intelligence in one
network component by disassociating the forwarding process of network
packets (data plane) from the routing process (control plane). The
control plane consists of one or more controllers which are considered
as the brain of SDN network where the whole intelligence is
incorporated. However, the intelligence centralization has its own
drawbacks when it comes to security, scalability and elasticity and this
is the main issue of SDN
