# SDP


Session Description Protocol

The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a format for describing
streaming media communications parameters. The IETF published the
original specification as an IETF Proposed Standard in April 1998, and
subsequently published a revised specification as an IETF Proposed
Standard as RFC 4566 in July 2006.

SDP is used for describing multimedia communication sessions for the
purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and parameter
negotiation. SDP does not deliver any media by itself but is used
between endpoints for negotiation of media type, format, and all
associated properties. The set of properties and parameters are often
called a session profile.

SDP is designed to be extensible to support new media types and formats.
SDP started off as a component of the Session Announcement Protocol
(SAP), but found other uses in conjunction with Real-time Transport
Protocol (RTP), Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) and even as a standalone format for describing multicast
sessions.
