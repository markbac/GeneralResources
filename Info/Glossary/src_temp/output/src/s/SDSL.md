Symmetrical Digital Subscriber Line

A symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL) is a digital subscriber line
(DSL) that transmits digital data over the copper wires of the telephone
network, where the bandwidth in the downstream direction, from the
network to the subscriber, is identical to the bandwidth in the upstream
direction, from the subscriber to the network. This symmetric bandwidth
can be considered to be the opposite of the asymmetric bandwidth offered
by asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) technologies, where the
upstream bandwidth is lower than the downstream bandwidth. SDSL is
generally marketed at business customers, while ADSL is marketed at
private as well as business customers.

More specifically, SDSL can be understood as:

- in the wider sense, an umbrella term for all DSL variant which offer
    symmetric bandwidth, including IDSL, which offers 144 kbit/s, HDSL,
    HDSL2, G.SHDSL, which offers up to 22.784 Mbit/s over four pairs of
    copper wires, as well as the SDSL variant below

- in the narrow sense, a particular proprietary and non-standardized
    DSL variant for operation at 1.544 Mbit/s or 2.048 Mbit/s over a
    single pair of copper wires, without support for analog calls on the
    same line

- a term used by ETSI to refer to G.SHDSL
