# SIP Trunk


SIP trunking enables the end point's PBX (Phone Exchange System) to send
and receive calls via Internet. As SIP is applied for the signalling
protocol for multiple real-time application, SIP trunk is able to
control voice, video and messaging applications.\
It is also a voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology and
streaming media service based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
by which Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs) deliver telephone
services and unified communications to customers equipped with SIP-based
private branch exchange (IP-PBX) and unified communications facilities.
