# SNTP


Simple Network time Protocol

A less complex implementation of NTP, using the same protocol but
without requiring the storage of state over extended periods of time, is
known as the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP). It is used in some
embedded devices and in applications where full NTP capability is not
required.
