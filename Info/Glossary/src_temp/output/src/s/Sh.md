# Sh


The Bourne shell (sh) is a shell, or command-line
interpreter, for computer operating systems.

The Bourne shell was the default shell for Version 7 Unix. Most
Unix-like systems continue to have /bin/sh---which will be the Bourne
shell, or a symbolic link or hard link to a compatible shell---even when
other shells are used by most users.
