# Snake Case


Snake case (or snake\_case) is the practice of writing compound words or
phrases in which the elements are separated with one underscore
character (\_) and no spaces, with each element's initial letter usually
lowercased within the compound and the first letter either upper- or
lowercase---as in "foo\_bar" and "Hello\_world". It is commonly used in
computer code for variable names, and function names, and sometimes
computer filenames.
