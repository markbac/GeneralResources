# Swift


Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming
language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and
Linux. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch
frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C (ObjC) code
written for Apple products. It is built with the open source LLVM
compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6. On
platforms other than Linux, it uses the Objective-C runtime library
which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one
program
