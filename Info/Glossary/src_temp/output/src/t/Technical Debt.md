# Technical Debt


Technical debt (also known as design debt or code debt) is a concept in
software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework
caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better
approach that would take longer.

Technical debt can be compared to monetary debt. If technical debt is
not repaid, it can accumulate 'interest', making it harder to implement
changes later on. Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy.
Technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes (e.g., as a
proof-of-concept) technical debt is required to move projects forward.
On the other hand, some experts claim that the "technical debt" metaphor
tends to minimize the impact, which results in insufficient
prioritization of the necessary work to correct it
