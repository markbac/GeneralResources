# Test Design


Provides a bridge between the *test cases* and the
product's *requirements* and *design*. Test design is analogous to
software design, and is used when test solutions require a significant
amount of analysis and defined structure.\
Test design is not software design necessary to support testing (e.g.,
design of an automated test framework).
