# V.90


V.90 is an ITU-T recommendation for a modem, allowing 56 kbit/s digital
download and 33.6 kbit/s analog upload. It replaced two vendor standards
(K56flex and X2) and was designed to allow modems from both prior
standards to be flash upgraded to support it. It was developed between
March 1998 and February 1999. It is also known as V.Last as it was
anticipated to be the last standard for modems operating near the
channel capacity of POTS lines to be developed. V.90 is generally used
in concert with the V.42bis compression standard. A follow-on standard,
V.92, was developed later in 1999 to replace V.90.
