# VBS


VB Script

VBScript ("Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition") is an Active
Scripting language developed by Microsoft that is modeled on Visual
Basic. It allows Microsoft Windows system administrators to generate
powerful tools for managing computers with error handling, subroutines,
and other advanced programming constructs. It can give the user complete
control over many aspects of their computing environment.

VBScript uses the Component Object Model to access elements of the
environment within which it is running; for example, the
FileSystemObject (FSO) is used to create, read, update and delete files.
VBScript has been installed by default in every desktop release of
Microsoft Windows since Windows 98; in Windows Server since Windows NT
4.0 Option Pack; and optionally with Windows CE (depending on the device
it is installed on).
