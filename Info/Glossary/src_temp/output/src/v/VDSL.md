Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line

Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) and very-high-bit-rate
digital subscriber line 2 [VDSL2](2) are digital subscriber line (DSL)
technologies providing data transmission faster than asymmetric digital
subscriber line (ADSL).

VDSL offers speeds of up to 52 Mbit/s downstream and 16 Mbit/s upstream,
over a single flat untwisted or twisted pair of copper wires using the
frequency band from 25 kHz to 12 MHz. These rates mean that VDSL is
capable of supporting applications such as high-definition television,
as well as telephone services (voice over IP) and general Internet
access, over a single connection. VDSL is deployed over existing wiring
used for analog telephone service and lower-speed DSL connections. This
standard was approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
in November 2001.

Second-generation systems (VDSL2; ITU-T G.993.2 approved in February
2006) use frequencies of up to 30 MHz to provide data rates exceeding
100 Mbit/s simultaneously in both the upstream and downstream
directions. The maximum available bit rate is achieved at a range of
about 300 meters; performance degrades as the local loop attenuation
increases.
