Video On Demand

Video on demand is a programming system which allows users to select and
watch/listen to video or audio content such as movies and TV shows
whenever they choose, rather than at a scheduled broadcast time, the
method that prevailed with over-the-air programming during the 20th
century. IPTV technology is commonly used to bring VOD to televisions
and personal computers.

Television VOD systems can stream content through either a set-top box,
a computer or other device, allowing viewing in real time, or download
it to a device such as a computer, digital video recorder (also called a
personal video recorder) or portable media player for viewing at any
time. The majority of cable- and telephone company-based television
providers offer:

- VOD streaming, whereby a user selects a video program and it begins
    to play immediately on the television set, or

- downloading to a digital video recorder (DVR) rented or purchased
    from the provider, or downloading onto a PC or to a portable device,
    for viewing in the future.

- Internet television, using the Internet, is an increasingly popular
    form of video on demand. VOD can also be accessed via desktop client
    applications such as the Apple iTunes online content store.

    Some airlines offer VOD as in-flight entertainment to passengers
    through individually controlled video screens embedded in seatback
    or armrests or offered via portable media players. Some video on
    demand services, such as Netflix, use a subscription model that
    requires users to pay a monthly fee to access a bundled set of
    content, which is mainly movies and TV shows. Other services use an
    advertising-based model, where access is free.
