Virtual Private Wire Service

Virtual Leased Lines (VLL) is a way to provide Ethernet-based point to
point communication over IP/MPLS networks.

The term Virtual Leased Line is also used to describe a point to point
bonded connection using the Broadband Bonding technology. This
implementation is bonded in layer 4.

In the industry, the technology is also referred to as Virtual Private
Wire Service (VPWS) or EoMPLS (Ethernet over MPLS).

VLL uses the pseudo-wire encapsulation for transporting Ethernet traffic
over an MPLS tunnel across an IP/MPLS backbone.
