# Vorbis


Vorbis is a free and open-source software project headed by the Xiph.Org
Foundation. The project produces an audio coding format and software
reference encoder/decoder (codec) for lossy audio compression. Vorbis is
most commonly used in conjunction with the Ogg container format and it
is therefore often referred to as Ogg Vorbis.
