Wireless Access Point

In computer networking, a wireless access point (WAP), or more generally
just access point (AP), is a networking hardware device that allows a
Wi-Fi device to connect to a wired network. The AP usually connects to a
router (via a wired network) as a standalone device, but it can also be
an integral component of the router itself. An AP is differentiated from
a hotspot, which is the physical location where Wi-Fi access to a WLAN
is available.
