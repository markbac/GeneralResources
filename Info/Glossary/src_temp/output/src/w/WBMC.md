Wholesale Broadband Managed Connect

The IPSC replacement\
In the same way that the vanilla WBC product could be seen as a
replacement for DataStream, WBMC can be seen as a replacement for
IPStream. This product is an end-to-end product, encompassing the EUA
(End User Access), presence at the APs (Aggregation Points), EPs
(Extension Paths) and an MSIL (Although the MSIL is purchased separately
by the ISP). Ultimately this saves the ISP having to manage and maintain
presence at the 20 WBC nodes (APs), which would involve considerable
initial outlay and ongoing investment. The backhaul is also managed by
BT entirely. On the other side of the coin this means the ISP is locked
in to a BT platform - which may not necessarily be the cheapest - and it
certainly does not offer all of the flexibility that an ISP using WBC
would receive. That said, all of the same products and QoS options are
available on WBMC as on WBC.
